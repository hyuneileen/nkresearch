The Understanding of the classification of parts of English Sentences Ri Jong Suk The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “Scientists and technicians must provide satisfactory solutions to the scientific and technical problems arising in making the national economy Juche-orientated, modern and scientifically-based.” (“KIM JONG IL SELECTED WORKS” Vol. 10 P. 194) The theory of classification of parts of sentences serves as a theoretical and practical basis to enable us to understand scientifically the characteristics and principle of the sentence structure to give the accurate methodology for the sentence translation depending on it. It can be said that the method of classifying parts of a sentence is a way useful for correct understanding and translation of English sentences. The theory of semantic component classification was basically formulated in Nida’s “Theories of Semantic Analysis” in 1973 after its earlier presentation in generative semantics helped by the first standard theory and analytic semantics started by Chomsky’s early standard theory. The theory of component classification being studied in linguistics is the meaning classification theory, which has been generally acknowledged to be of some significance in clarifying the semantic structure of words. But the principle of component classification can be useful not only in teaching word structure but also in teaching sentence structure. classification. The method of classification of parts of sentences is basically a part of the theories of linguistic In essence, the classification of parts of sentences is a process of confirming the semantic-structural functions by analyzing the sentence components in view of the interrelationship of the individual words which form the integrated sentences. A sentence, the main unit of speech act, is a structural body which is formed by the integrated and comprehensive interrelation which is made by the fitting relation of the individual words. Here the integrated fitting relation of the individual words means the semantic combination of the words and the comprehensive interrelation means the semantically- binding relation of the sentence components. Like this, the words go into the integrated sentence structure by forming the interrelation with each other. To understand the classification of parts of sentences of modern English we should consider, the units of sentence classification, its binding methods, the fitting relation of the sentence components. First of all, we should consider the methods of classifying sentence. The problem of classification of parts of sentences can be considered in several ways. The classification of parts of sentences can be made possible by the method of grammatical classification of parts of sentence from structural-functional aspect, by the method of integral classification of parts of sentences from phonetic-semantic aspect and by method of communicative classification of parts of sentences from logical-semantic aspect. － 114 － Among them the most widely-used method is one of classifying parts of sentences grammatically. The method of grammatical classification of parts of sentences is a process of classifying the individual words in the sentence in terms of parts of speech to identify the semantic elements of the sentence as semantic components of the sentences based on the confirmation of the interrelation of the words. That is, it is a process of classifying grammatically the constituent parts of sentences such as word, phrase, clause and of making clear their syntactical functions from semantic and structural aspect. Next, in classifying parts of sentences, we should make clear the units of sentence classification and their combining methods. The units of the sentence classification can be the subjects and predicates primarily, the objects and adverbial modifiers according to the semantic and structural characteristics of predicate verbs, and finally the attributes. The sentence components which are classified grammatically carry the characteristics that all the elements constituting them are the independent factors. The units of classification of parts of sentences can also be the phrases and clauses which can be classified as independent semantic elements in the sentences. In sentences the individual words do not exist in isolation, but in semantic and structural combination, having some syntactical relations, depending on certain grammatical rules. So the classification of parts of sentences is a process of analysing the internal relations of the word combinations. The internal relation of the word combinations here means the bindiing characteristics of the sentence components which combine in direct or indirect way and their interrelations. The sentence components in English are bound in the way of “simple combination” (word + word)  The main form of the internal relations of the word combination is the simple combination. It is the word combination which has only one binding relation of more than 2 independent words. The word combinations are classified into the subordinating combination and   coordinating combination depending on the binding characteristics of the constituent elements. In the subordinating combination, the internal relation of the word combination is realized by the “head word” and in the coordinating combination is made by the coordinating conjunctions which link the words. The English subordinating combination is realised by “dependent word + head word”, “head word + dependent word” and in terms of types, it is divided into subjective, objective, adverbial and attributive combinations. ex: - dependent + head                 steadfast faith and mettle                dependent        head          - head word + dependent word              a party  that serves the people                 head        dependent － 115 － Here the heads are the words denoting the objects while the dependents are the words denoting the adverbial and attributive modifiers. Distinct from the subordinating combination, the coordinating combination is realised by the words of equal footing; for example, between verbs, nouns and adjectives because it is a combination of the words of equal status. ex: a more affluent and civilized life  The main of word combination in a sentence is the subordinating combination of “dependent + head”, but the words in coordinating combination can have the subordinating relation with other words.  So the subordinating combination which is “simple combination” (word + word) in English sentences is realised with priority given to the verb(predicative word) and noun(objective word), in general. The classification of parts of sentences in English can be also realised by “extended combination” (word × phrase) and (word ×clause) in structure. The impersonal verbs and componential elements in English form a constituent unit in semantic-grammatical and rhythmical sense to be the dependents inside subordinating relation with other words in sentence. Like this, the dependents are grouped into phrases, sometimes into clauses to realise the interrelation with the head word. Such combinations are called the extended combination. In other words, that is, the extended combination enables the phrases formed with more than simple combinations which consisted of three or more independent words. So, we can say that the English extended combinations are formed by (word × phrase) and (word × clause) in structure. components. Next, in classification of parts of sentences is made clear the fitting relation of sentence The classification of parts of sentences can be studied not only in terms of the internal relation of the word combinations, but also in terms of their external relations. To the interrelation of the individual words belong the external relations showing the function played in detailed sentences by the word combinations as well as the internal relations showing the relationship of combination of the individual words. The internal relation of the sentence components serves as the way to analyse the binding relations of the sentence components themselves primarily while the external relation serves the way to analyse their semantic-structural functions through the binding relation of several components of sentence. What is more important in classifying the parts of sentences is to make clear their syntactical functions in view of the external relations of the word combinations (sentence components) in sentences. The sentence components in English enter the interrelations, placing predicate in the semantic-structural centre and are put in their proper places to combine together. So in order to make clear the syntactical binding relations and the functions of the sentence components in English, we should first of all find out the predicate element which is the semantic-structural centre of sentence inside the external relation of the word combinations. － 116 － When the predicate component is found out in sentence, it helps to identify the sentence components one by one which are combined by the syntactical binding rules of English. The sentences may be extended in complicated way by the possibility of the binding relations of the words. But when the external relations of the word combinations lead to the combination with other words, phrases and clauses according to the syntactical binding rules, they form again the external relations to make larger the sentence structure. As seen above, the classification of parts of sentences in mophological-structural way and in semantic-functional way the sentences which consist of the structures independent both from semantic and structural aspects; namely, a work to make clear the roles and functions of the semantic elements in sentences. is a work to analyse We should study the theory of classification of the parts of sentence more profoundly to contribute to the English education such as understanding and translation of the English sentences in theoretical and practical way. － 117 －
