Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 3 Juche103(2014) New MAEAM Potential Models for BCC, FCC and HCP Metals Jin Hak Son Abstract The calculation results of structure energy differences misfit the experiment data for BCC, FCC and HCP metals in the original modified analytic embedded atom method (MAEAM) theory [1]. To resolve this problem, we not only adopt an end processing function and an enhanced smooth continuous condition, but also adjust parameters of multi-body potential model by fitting cohesion energies, mono-vacancy formation energies, Rose equation curves for total energy as a function of lattice parameter, energy differences between several typical structures, elastic parameters, equilibrium conditions of crystals. Key words BCC metal, FCC metal; HCP metals, EAM  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “Now is the age of science and technology, which is the basis of economic progress.” (“KIM JONG IL SELECTED WORKS” Vol. 10 P. 22) The modified analytic embedded atom method (MAEAM) was suggested to resolve the negative Cauchy pressure problem of Jonson’s model [1]. And the farther neighbor atoms are considered to improve the correctness of the calculation results by this method [2, 3]. But this MAEAM still has some points to improve, including the structure stabilities of noble metals, the properties of the end parts the derivatives of the pair potential function, and the misfitting problem of the calculation results of energy differences between several structures with experimental data. In this paper, new pair potential forms and a new end processing method are suggested for the three kinds of typical structures of metals (BCC, FCC, HCP metals) in the framework of MAEAM theory. In order to resolve the misfitting problem between calculated results and experimental data for the energy differences between several structures of metals, input data include one of these differences. Two model parameters become unnecessary because of the adoption of the end processing function. Through adjusting one of these two parameters, the many-body potential becomes fit to the experimental data of one structure energy difference. Through adjusting another parameter, we can fit the potential to the experimental data of phonon frequency at a certain value of the vibration number for several metals. － 57 － follows [2]. Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 3 Juche103(2014) 1．New Pair Potential Forms and Model Parameters The basic equations of MAEAM for the total energy of a system of atoms are as (1) E i = F ( ρ i ) + ( φ r ij ) + ( PM i ) (2) E t = E i n ∑ i 1 = 1 2 ∑ j where tE is total energy of system, Ei is the contribution from the atom at site i, embedded atom energy, ( iF ρ the ) the pair potential between the atoms at sites i and j, and ) ( ijrφ ( iPM ) the energy medication term.

By combining the three equations for the elastic constants with the equation for the cohesive energy and the equation of the equilibrium condition, the five parameters such as k0～k3 and α can be determined. The computational cell is a crystal sphere of radius 2a with 65 atoms, in which a is a lattice constant of the considered metal. In order to resolve the misfitting problem between calculated results and experimental data for the energy differences between several structures of transition metals, input physical data include one of these differences. Two model parameters become unnecessary because of the adoption of the end processing function, through adjusting one of these two parameters (k–1 in this paper, k4 is unnecessary and set to zero), the many-body potential becomes fit to the structure energy difference. In [8] they obtained a universal equation of energy versus volume empirically for a broad range of materials. To ensure reasonable behavior for atom–atom interactions inside the equilibrium spacing, this empirical relationship is fitted by adjusting parameter n, the value of n is accepted as a model parameter which provides the minimum value of ∆S in the follow expression ⋅ 3 10 [ ( aE 21 ∑ 1 i = (01.09.0[ i + −⋅ ) i S =Δ a i = )]1 ⋅ a − ( aE R i ] 2 ) / e 20 / aa i 1 − (22) where E(ai) and ER(ai) are the calculation result of our model and the Rose equation respectively. The volume change is smaller, the difference between the two results has a greater effect upon the sum in the above expression by the adoption of exponential function. If there is no minimum of ∆S in 0<n<1, the mono-vacancy migration energy becomes the object of fitting. After k-1 and n are determined，k0～k3 and α can be obtained by solving the five linear equations. The input parameters used in this paper are the lattice constant a, cohesive energy Ec, mono-vacancy formation energy E1f, elastic constants C11, C12 and C44, and structure energy difference Efb (between FCC and BCC structures) and the calculated model parameters n, α, F0, and k-1～k3 are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively for seven bcc metals (Cr, Fe, Mo, Nb, Ta, V and W). － 60 － New MAEAM Potential Models for BCC, FCC and HCP Metals Table 1.

The computational cell is a crystal sphere of radius 2a with 141 atoms, the method of determining model parameters is very similar to the one used for BCC metals: k4 is determined by fitting one of structure energy differences, k5 is set to zero for Ag, Al, Au, Cu, Ir and Ni. For Pd, Pt and Rh, k5 is determined by fitting the experimental data of the crystal wave frequency corresponding to the wave number vector (2π/a 0 0), which are 6.7THz, 5.9THz, and 9.5THz respectively [8]. Rose equation is fitted in calculation of n，for Al, Au, Ni and Rh, there no exist the minimum of ∆S in the variation range of n，therefore the experimental data of mono-vacancy migration energy are fitted, which are 0.645, 0.854 1.55 and 2.967eV respectively [8]. After k4, k5 and n are determined，k0～k3 and α can be obtained by solving the equations (19)～(21).

After k–1, β and n are determined，k0～k5 and α can be obtained by solving the equations (19), (33), and (34). The input parameters are the lattice constant a, cohesive energy Ec, mono-vacancy formation energy E1f, elastic constants C11, C12, C13, C33 and C44, and structure energy difference Ebh (between BCC and HCP structures) and Efh (between FCC and HCP structures) used in this paper and the calculated model parameters n, α, β, F0, and k-1 to k5 for ten HCP metals are listed in tables 5 and 6 respectively. Conclusion  In the present paper, the traditional MAEAM theory considering farther neighbor atoms is improved for three structures of metals. The pair potential functions are truncated by adopting a new function form and an enhanced smooth continuous condition. The parameters of multi- body potential model are also adjusted to fit the experimental data of cohesive energy, elastic constants, the result from Rose equation, structure energy difference, and equilibrium conditions of crystals for the 26 kinds of metals. Resultantly, the calculation results from these potentials show good agreement with experimental results for the structure energy differences, the bi-vacancy bind energies, the bulk phonon dispersion, the specific heats, and so on.
