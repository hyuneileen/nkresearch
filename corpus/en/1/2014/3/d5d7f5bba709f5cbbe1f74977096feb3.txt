Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 3 Juche103(2014) Effect on the Treatment of the Abnormal Gait by the Sacral Occipital Technique and the Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation Kim Jin Suk Abstract We have studied to find out the effect of the treatment of abnormal gait and to improve the evaluative indices of the gait by using the Sacral Occipital Technique (SOT) category II, III method and the Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation. In order to collect the clinic data to treat the cases with abnormal gait we have applied the SOT category II, III method and the evaluative indices of the gait such as width of the base, average length of a step and average number of a step. Also we have studied to find out the effect of the treatment of the abnormal gait by using SOT category II, III method and the therapeutic electrical stimulation. The SOT category II, III method improves the evaluative indices of the abnormal gait, especially antalgic gait positively. The overall effective rate of the SOT category II, III and the therapeutic electrical stimulation on the abnormal gait is about 92.5%. Key words abnormal gait, antalgic gait, sacral occipital technique (SOT), therapeutic electrical stimulation, kinetic chain, biomechanical balance  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “The development of curative and preventive work and success in medical services depend largely on how advanced methods of diagnosis and treatment are adopted.”(“ON THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE HEALTH SERVICE” P.12) Recently many patients are suffering from pain of the kinetic chain such as the lumbar, shoulder girdle, knees, and the rest of the body, and especially prolonged antalgic gait can affect the serve normal movement. For example, an ankle pain can lead to low-back one, and low-back pain can affect the serve normal gait [3, 6, 7, 10]. Category II condition can result from a postural problem and cause imbalances of muscles in foot, ankle, knee, hip as well as shoulder and neck, and so on. The category II condition is musculoskeletal imbalance affecting the entire body, not just the back. When the SI (sacral iliac) joint is unstable, the muscles above and below of the pelvis contract to compensate. Category III is a result of the body‘s failure to adapt to the category II, and category III is often associated with sciatic radiation down the posterior leg, antalgic, numbness, muscular weakness, severe pain and spasm. The asymmetrical tension on the lumbar muscle, shoulder girdle, knees, and the rest of the body causes abnormal gait [5, 7－10]. Therefore it is necessary for us to find out more effective － 99 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 3 Juche103(2014) methods that can be applied to prevent and treat prolonged antalgic gait suffering from pain of the kinetic chain. There are various conservative treatments such as pharmacotherapy heat and cold therapy, traction therapy, acupuncture, manipulation, electrical stimulation and so on for the treatment of the pain [1, 10]. At present Sacral Occipital Technique is well recognized as one kind of chiropractic technique not only adjusting imbalance of spinal nerve, muscle and bone but also reduction of the pain in kinetic chain, which contains the adjustment of pelvis by blocking [2, 4, 8]. We established antalgic gait due to pain of kinetic chain and have studied to find out the changes of the evaluative indices of the gait and the effect of the treatment of the abnormal gait by using (SOT) category II, III method and the Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation. 1. Research Object and Research Method 1.1. Research object We have treated 70 patients suffering from the antalgic gait in the rehabilitation department, the Pyongyang Medical College Hospital of Kim Il Sung University, from March to November in 2013. Among the patients male and female were 41 cases (58.5%) and 29 cases (41.5%) respectively, and 40 to 60-year old cases were 61 cases (87.1%). 1.2. Research method First, we have studied to find out the changes of the evaluative indices of the gait and the subjective symptoms. In order to collect the clinic data to treat the cases with abnormal gait we have applied the SOT category II, III method and the evaluative indices of the gait such as width of the base, average length of a step and average number of a step. Also we have studied to find out the effect of the treatment of the abnormal gait by using SOT category II, III method and the therapeutic electrical stimulation. For the study group, we have applied the SOT category II, III method the therapeutic electrical stimulation and have applied above methods simultaneously. The SOT category II, III method is in the manner described in “Sacral Occipital Technique Participant Guide” by SORSI [7]. Otherwise, for the control group we have applied therapeutic electrical stimulation. 1.3. Instruments Block, digital therapy machine or other kinds of electrical stimulation devices are utilized. Treatment is applied once a day or other day and 1 course has over 7 days. 1.4. Indicators of observation We have applied subjective symptoms such as low back pain, leg pain, and pain during walking and objective symptoms such as width of the base, average length of a step and average number of a step. As instrument examinations we have applied EMG (velocity on conduction of peripheral nerve). － 100 － Effect on the Treatment of the Abnormal Gait by the SacralOccipital Technique and … 1.5. Criteria to treatment Cured means subjective and objective symptoms have been disappeared and there are remarkable improvements in the instrument examination, effect means there remain pains in walking but no pains in the rest, while there are improvements in the instrument examination and no effect means there remain all symptoms and no improvements in the instrument examination. 2.
