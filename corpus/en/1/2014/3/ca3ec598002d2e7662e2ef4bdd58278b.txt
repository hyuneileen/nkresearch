Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 3 Juche103(2014) Measuring Research about Several Indices for Maxillofacial Contouring Plastic Surgery Pyon Song Nam, Jong Kang Ho, Kim Song Hyon, Ri Song Hui and Kwon Yong Sim Abstract We have made facial contouring programme by computer to resolve measurement index necessary to quantity diagnosis, treatment and effect judgement of maxillofacial contouring plastic surgery and measured several indices for maxillofacial contouring plastic surgery of 400 volunteers. As a measurement result, there is no significant difference between direct and indirect and especially as programme measurement, several indices such as Zy-Zy, CMl, CMr, RMl, RMr, Mal, Mar, MeA are 123.93±15.02, 68.90±12.33, 69.12±11.52, 71.36±3.87, 72.15±4.73, 108.18±11.58, 109.75±12.5, 114.4±11.56. And proportion of distance between bilateral zygomatic points and distance between bilateral gonions is 1.12 for male and 1.05 for female. Key words maxillofacial contouring, facial measurement, computer measurement programme  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “The most important factor in the current development of medical science and technology is to concentrate on solving the pressing scientific and technological problems in the health service.”(“ON THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE HEALTH SERVICE” P.18) We have maxillofacial contouring plastic surgery because of feature transformation after facial trauma, tumor excision and abnormality of jaw development. Recently maxillofacial contouring plastic surgery has gradually turning into quantity diagnosis and treatment from quality in the worldwide. According to recent data, there is method which makes human face model by 3D program and manages the result [1], manufactures 3D face model by using some radiographic films [2] and manufactures 3D face model automatically by several measurement points [3, 4] on images. And individualizing method of face and calculating method of several directions pattern images [7, 8] by research about wrinkle pattern images are also suggested. According to the other data, it is suggested method which reconstruct 3D facial contouring by synthesizing facial photo and data which input digital image to computer, measure facial contouring indices and uses it to diagnosis, treatment and operation effect judgment [5, 6, 10]. But most of them must use expensive instruments such as specialized 3DCT (three dimensions computer tomography) [9] and MRI and complicated handling and long processing time and need experts. And in the maxillofacial contouring plastic department there is no data about measuring and analyzing program. We have made computer program by using digital image, confirmed its possibility and taken measuring research for measuring reference indices necessary to maxillofacial contouring plastic surgery. － 90 － Measuring Research about Several Indices for Maxillofacial Contouring Plastic Surgery 1. Experimental Instruments and Method 1.1. Experimental instruments As used instruments for measurement, there are digital camera (SONY), computer [CPU 1.8G, 1.79G, RAM 496MB], a division ruler and a protractor and our facial measurement program 1.0. 1.2. Research object There are 400 volunteers whose body is healthy, development is normal, craniofacial relation is harmonious and facial contouring is normal and symmetry without deformation and transformation. The male is 100 members and female is 300 members and their age is 18 to 35(the average is 22.2). 1.3. Research method 1.3.1. Measurement index on the face for maxillofacial contouring plastic surgery  As facial measurement indices, there are zygomatic distance (bilateral zygomatic points distance; zygomata, Zy-Zy), gonion distance (bilateral gonion points distance), length of ramus of man- dible(distance to point of mandible angle from condylar process: left and right is noted respectively as RMl and RMr), length of corpus of mandible(distance to inferior margin of mandible corresponding anterior margin of ramus of mandible from central symphysis of mandible, left and right is noted respectively as CMl and CMr), Degree of mandibular angle(Angle that inferior margin of mandibular ramus crosses with posterior margin of mandibular ramus: left and right is noted respectively as Mal and Mar), degree of mental angle and ratio of zygomatic points distance and mandibular angle point distance. 1.3.2. Measuring method We took photographs of them with a little upper chin and eyes of saggital plane to perfect in measurement. is straight. 1.3.3. Direct measurement We used direct measurement method of facial surface. In a short, under the natural light intensity, volunteer is sat at seat and bilateral eye’s line Measurement unit is millimeter and accuracy is 0.1mm. Angle measurement unit is degree (°). Measurement object is 60 members of male and 60 members of female of 400 volunteers. 1.3.4. Measurement method by facial measuring program  We took pictures of them with security and body posture a little upper jaw and eyes of saggital plane to perfect in measurement. left side of face and underside of jaw. Under the normal light intensity, we input pictures after we took ones of front side, right and And we get started program and analyzed images. Measurement object is 100 members of male and 300 members of female. － 91 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 3 Juche103(2014) 2. Results and Conclusion 2.1. Relation between direct and program measurement At first, we examined accuracy and usage possibility of facial measurement program made by us. The index measured by direct and program in male is as table 1, 2. For each index, significant difference between direct and program measurement index has not been recognized. In table 2, for each index in female, significant difference between direct and program measurement index has not been recognized. Table 1. Result of measured by direct and program in male Table 2.
