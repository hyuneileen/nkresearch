Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 3 Juche103(2014) Determination on the Distribution of Temperature and Velocity of Nitrogen Plasma Flow by Lattice Boltzmann Method Pae Song Gil Abstract Because the most of plasma flows are turbulent in spraying, the distribution of temperature and velocity of plasma turbulent flow are determined correctly to increase the quality of spraying. In previous studies [1－8], to study the plasma turbulent flow by using the lattice Boltzmann method, turbulent viscosity tμ was assumed being linear relation with density ρ , and thus turbulent characteristics could not be accounted correctly. We combined the lattice Boltzmann method with ω−k obtain the distribution of temperature and velocity of nitrogen arc plasma flow. Key words plasma, lattice Boltzmann method, ω−k  1. Theoretical Consideration The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Efforts should be made to develop cell engineering, gene engineering, superhigh- pressure physics and ultracryogenics, exploit atomic, solar and other new sources of energy and study closely lasers and plasma so that these can be used extensively in the national economy.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 35 P. 313) two equation turbulent models to model Plasma flow used in plasma spraying is usually turbulent flow, because its temperature and velocity is very high.

Radial distribution also decrease rapidly when far from axis and those tendency dominant when approach toward the nozzle of plasmatron.
