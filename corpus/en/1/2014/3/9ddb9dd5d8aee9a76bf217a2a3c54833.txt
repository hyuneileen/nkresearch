Key words forward and backward scattering, refractive index profile  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Long-term research should be conducted with a view to opening up new scientific fields and introducing the latest developments in science and technology widely in the national economy.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 35 P. 313) The refractive index profile of the optical fiber core plays an important role in characterizing the optical properties of the fiber. It allows determination of the fiber numerical aperture, the number of propagation modes within the fiber core and the dispersion of the fiber’s material. Therefore, the detailed knowledge of the refractive index profile allows the prediction of the impulse response of the fiber and consequently the information carrying capacity of the fiber can be estimated. The ideal measuring method should satisfy the following conditions: non destructive, applicable to any profile, high measurement accuracy, high resolution and easy measurement and data processing. Different methods were used to determine the fiber’s refractive index profile such as: near field method, X-ray microanalysis, scanning electron microscope and interferometric methods. properties of fibers [1－5]. Many investigators have applied interferometric techniques to determine the optical A method capable of measuring both the refractive index and the diameter of optical fibers based on the analysis of the backscattered light, when a beam from a cw laser is incident perpendicular to the fiber axis, has been reported. But study results that put an comprehensive interpretation on forward and backward scattering distribution of light by step- index fiber not sufficient [6, 7]. The aim of the present work is to study the forward and backward scattering distribution of laser beam by the step-index profile of optical fibers. － 51 － follows.

Interpretation Results The refractive indices of the core and the cladding and the difference between them and the diameter of the core are the basic parameters that specify the information transmission characteristics of the fiber.

In the backward scattering light strength distribution the larger the difference between indices core and cladding, the larger the interval between first maximum and second maximum of the backward scattering light strength distribution. The position of first maximum angle depends on only the index of cladding. the backward scattering light strength distribution have modulated due to the presence of core different to index of cladding and thus and appeared the second maximum. The index of core have an effect on modulation only. And the radius change of core of the step-index fiber give rise to the modulation of the forward scattering light strength distribution. The larger the difference between indices of core and cladding, the more is number of modulation pattern in the forward scattering light strength distribution and the narrower is half width of modulation curve. － 55 － References Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 3 Juche103(2014) [1] A.
