Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 3 Juche103(2014) Real Time Temperature Prediction Method of Furnace by New Fuzzy Modeling Method and Its Realization Kim Nam Hyok, Kwak Son Il Abstract We discovered the defect through researching about previous modeling technology[1, 2] and resolved the rank lack problem requested in calculation of 30－40th dimensional matrix. Then we proceeded the furnace temperature prediction examination by a way of real time fuzzy prediction modeling method applying new fuzzy reasoning theory [3, 4], and then by comparing with previous temperature prediction temperature [5－7], verified the effectiveness of proposed method. In this paper we applied the new fuzzy modeling method proposed by us and established the furnace temperature prediction model, and then compared with previous temperature prediction methods through simulation experiments and field experiments and evaluated its effectiveness. Key words fuzzy modeling, predication model, fuzzy reasoning method, move rate Introduction In the paper[2], for solving the problem of the real time temperature predication problem is provided an adaptive identification algorithm based on regressive model. But the regressive model that characteristics of the furnace is represented only a formula have difficulty in the modeling of nonlinearity of the objects(furnaces) and have accuracy of about 85%. There are a lot of researches methods of modeling of the nonlinear objects, in the paper[4] is proposed a fuzzy modeling method based on fuzzy reasoning method[5] and then verified its effectiveness. However the fuzzy modeling method of the paper[4] is impossible to use it conclusion parameter estimation. Otherwise in the papers[8, 9] is proposed a fuzzy identification algorithm for temperature predication of furnace and realized predication of only 3hours. But in the indusial processes are used 3 sensors for the 1 furnace and accuracy of predication model lows. In this paper, to overcome disadvantages of the past papers[2, 8, 9], the fuzzy reasoning method based on the move rate of the papers[3, 6, 7] is used in the fuzzy model identification and proposed a new method of real time temperature predication of the furnace and then compared with past methods throw simulation and test of furnaces and then verified its effectiveness. － 20 － Real Time Temperature Prediction Method of Furnace by New Fuzzy Modeling Method … 1.

Temperature Prediction Model Making of Furnace and Verification For making Temperature prediction model of furnace, we proceeded as following steps. ① Measure the temperature of furnace by thermocouple and construct the database set of input and output by extracting voltage and current data server. ② Applying this proposed fuzzy modeling method on this database set, make the temperature prediction model and evaluate its correctness by comparing with previous fuzzy modeling method. ③ Evaluate whether made temperature prediction model represent the temperature characteristic of furnace correctly or not and verify its validity. Fuzzy modeling program for making the temperature prediction model is programmed by MATLAB and the real time temperature prediction of furnace by this temperature prediction model is realized by C++. By applying dynamic T-S fuzzy modeling method based product reasoning, we made the temperature prediction model of 60 furnaces. Fig. 1 shows the output value of temperature prediction model and real value for furnace No 2. Fig. 1. Model output value by MATLAB and real value of furnace No 2 － 23 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 3 Juche103(2014) In Fig. 2, the accuracy of model is 99. 86% and mean error between model output and real value is 0.315℃. Fig. 2. Output value of model got by ANFIS and real value (Furnace No. 2) Fig. 2 shows the output value of fuzzy model got by ANFIS and real output value in furnace No 2. The accuracy of model of Fig. 2 is 99.76% and mean error between output value and real value is 2.289℃. The number of rules of model got by ANFIS are 25, but by proposed fuzzy modeling method is only 5, and the mean error of proposed method is smaller as 2~3 times than ANFIS from simulation experiment result, so that we can know that applying the proposed method is very efficient. Below table shows the comparison of experiment result that we proceed in field by previous result[1] and proposed method. Table. The comparison of previous result[1] and proposed method Maximum deviation/℃ Minimum deviation/℃ Mean deviation/℃ Model accuracy/℃ No. 1 2 3 Furnace number No 15 No 48 No 89 Method Proposed Previous Proposed Previous Proposed Previous 4.6 4.8 6.2 7.3 11.1 8.6 0.1 1.1 0.8 1.6 0.4 1.9 1.57 2.5 2.94 2.4 6.05 2.6 99.84 88.45 99.71 83.67 99.40 82.56 Considering the table, the model accuracy is about 85% and the proposed method is about 99%. That is, though previous method[1] proceed the model updating by interval measurement, the accuracy of model didn’t reach at 91%. That cause is that previous research try to get the furnace model, nonlinear object, by only a equation as mentioned over. Overall, through the simulation experiment by MATLAB and field experiment by matching MATLAB, MYSQL and C++, it was verified practically that the application of the proposed method proceeded successfully. － 24 － Real Time Temperature Prediction Method of Furnace by New Fuzzy Modeling Method … References  [1] 최정호 등; 현대지능정보처리리론, 종합대학출판사, 65, 주체101(2012).
