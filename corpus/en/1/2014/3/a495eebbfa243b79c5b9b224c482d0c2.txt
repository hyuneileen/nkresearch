Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 3 Juche103(2014) A Method to Determinate the Scaleless Interval of Fractal based on Wavelet Transformation So Hyo Son, Kim Jong Chol Abstract Fractal dimension is being widely used as a powerful tool for signal analysis in digital signal processing fields. It is important to estimate correctly fractal dimension exhibiting the feature of signal in digital signal processing with fractal. So we have to set up good fractal measure and select correctly the scaleless interval in the fractal curve. transformation is proposed. In the paper a method for automatically selecting scaleless interval of fractal curve by wavelet Key words fractal dimension, scaleless interval, wavelet transformation, 3-D spline  Introduction  Fractal theory was firstly proposed by Mandelbrot in 80’s of 20th century. It is a non- linear science and has already influenced to the various fields [3, 4]. The fractal of real world is in some layers and it has fractal property in statistical meaning. So scale rule is materialize in certain ranges and these ranges are called scaleless interval [1, 8]. It is very important to decide the scaleless interval correctly. Identifying the scaleless interval clearly is to find a segmentation which has the widest linear range in double log coordinate system. Correlation coefficient test method, three broken line method, self adaptation standard error methods are suggested for detecting the scaleless interval correctly [10, 12]. These methods do not identify regular bending correctly, and have to take possible combination of segments to raise the reliability of result, but at this time, there are a lot of faults in taking the combination if scale range is too large. At the same time, to find the position of bending interval in data curve is very important to raise the accuracy of scaleless interval detection using statistical regression. But in previous researches [5 － 7, 12], it doesn’t make clearly, which linear interval of any segmentation is regarded as scaleless interval, if there are many broken line of data point. But if scaleless interval is selected manually, it can detect the bending of data point curve more quickly and clearly. On the other hands, wavelet analysis’s multi scale resolution ability and focus feature is completely similar to visual feature of person, so if wavelet analysis is used, scaleless interval － 26 － A Method to Determinate the Scaleless Interval of Fractal based on Wavelet Transformation may be found quickly and correctly, and at the same time self-adaptively [2]. This paper proposes a method to distinguish exactly, the scaleless interval utilizing the wavelet transformation modulus maximum line and wavelet transformation multi scale differential property. 1. Problem Establishment The most important feature of fractal object is self-similarity and it is expressed with a change of correlation integral curve to straight line in double log coordinate system. But fractal object in nature has absolute self-similarity structure not on infinite layers, but on finite layers [9]. This means that the correlation integral curve has several statistical regression straight line segmentations in double log coordinate system. Decision of the scaleless interval of scale range which corresponds to the longest segment among these statistical regression straight line segmentations is the main problem in fractal application. In [9, 11], it is considered that fractal scaleless interval may be automatically identified based on wavelet modulus maximum curve method, but this method not only has large operation burden but also can’t be applied in detection of the statistical regression straight line interval. In this paper, to select the scaleless interval decision quickly and raise the accuracy, smooth the points on double log coordinate system and then it is proved that the longest straight line interval using the high speed wavelet transformation which moment order is 2 in its smoothing(or interpolation) spline can be found. 2.

And method in [9] is only available for 1D fractal curve and not proper in calculation of image fractal dimension. Moreover, if several linear intervals exist, this method can’t give the accurate linear interval. － 30 － A Method to Determinate the Scaleless Interval of Fractal based on Wavelet Transformation Conclusion  We proposed a method that can raise the accuracy of FD calculation to detect exactly scaleless interval based on wavelet transformation. It is shown that the proposed method can improve the calculation accuracy, because it can detect the linear interval in fractal autocorrelation curve more correctly in calculating FD of natural image.
