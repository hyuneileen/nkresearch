Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 3 Juche103(2014) The Analysis of Stratum Structure based on a Coupling Model of Void Damage and Crack Kim In Bong, Ri Chol Su Abstract We considered mechanical modeling of complicated stratum structure with damage including voids, defects and cracks in the framework of continuum damage mechanics. We represented voids and defects in material using damage tensor based on concept of effective stress and modeled cracks on the basis of exact crack theory. According to this modelling we determined stiffness characteristic quantity of stratum material and analyzed stress and displacement of stratum structure with cracks and void damage using ANSYS on the basis of it. Key words opened crack, closed crack, void, damage  Introduction  Generally, stratum structures consist of complicated medium where simultaneously exist various discontinuities like various kinds of micro and macro voids (cavities), microcracks, joints and stratifications. There are several methods to estimate strain states of discontinuous bedrocks, which can be divided into stochastic and deterministic method mainly. In the stochastic methods it gives the distribution characteristics of the discontinuous face in probability based on test data for the discontinuity of the rock and is approximating the discontinuous rock to the continuity which is equivalent to it. These are the crack theory and the estimation method of deformity on the basis of crack tensor [1]. This method is helpful to determine macroscopic state of rock, but not suitable to determine stress state in local domain of rock. On the other hand, in the deterministic methods there is a method to model the discontinuity of rock as real geometrical form and FEM using gap element belongs to it [2]. But the disadvantage of FEM using gap elements is to increase rapidly the volume of calculation in large number of cracks. Besides in the continuum damage mechanics it represents cracks, defects and voids only by concept of damage and the damage problem is solved on the basis of the concept of the Kachanov effective stress [3 － 5]. But in the strict meaning the crack problem yields the correct results by using the crack theory, which differs from the effective stress theory. In literature [6] the Helmholtz free energy is presented by using the constants of damage tensor and stiffness characteristic quantity declined as damage even with the crack closure effect (MK model) are given. The shortcoming of this model is that material constants 1η ,  － 8 － The Analysis of Stratum Structure based on a Coupling Model of Void Damage and Crack 2η , 3η , 4η should be determined for determination of model. There were suggested the various models representing the some damage behaviors [7, 8] beside MK model. On the basis of the quasibrittle model in literature [7] a plane 2D problem was analyzed by using ABAQUS program. In the scope of this model were considered the damage problems of the ice layer material and the concrete layer material. In this paper, we considered the mechanical modelling of the complicated stratum material with the damage including voids, defects and cracks in the framework of the continuum damage mechanics. We represented the voids and defects within material using the damage tensor based on the concept of the effective stress and modeled the cracks on the basis of exact crack theory. According to this modelling, we determined the stiffness characteristic quantities of the stratum material and analyzed stresses and displacements of the stratum structure with cracks and void damage using ANSYS. 1. The Coupling Model of the Continuous Damage and the Crack Let us represent the voids, defects etc. in the structure in the framework of the continuum damage mechanics by using the damage tensor introducing concept of the effective stress based on the hypothesis of the strain equivalency and modelling cracks by crack theory (Fig. 1). We suppose that the size of an element is so enough big that it involves the voids and defects. Fig. 1. Concept of the effective stress and hypothesis of the strain equivalency a) physical space, b) effective space Set U is the strain energy density of the elastic body, V is the supplement energy density. In this case it has following formula. U = εσ ij ij − V (1) Stress tensor ijσ is expressed by damage tensor pjφ as follows [3]. where ipklK -elastic stiffness matrix, φσ = pj ij =δφ pj pj K ε kl ipkl , pjδ -Kronecker delta, D− pj (2) pjD -damage tensor － 9 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 3 Juche103(2014) (if it is D pj = D ξ≡ , it is isotropic scalar damage parameter). If we coincide the global coordinates system with principal damage coordinates system, pjφ is represented the principal value of the damage tensor )3,2,1 1 −= . = iφ iDi ( If we regard the expression (2), the formula (1) is as follows. U = φ pj K εε ij kl ipkl − V (3) In the formulas (1), (3) the supplement energy V is as follows. V = φ pj K εε ij kl Δ+ V c ipkl (4) 1 2 where cVΔ the supplement energy by crack. The mechanical behavior of the crack is connected with the stress states acting on the crack face. If in the plane problems we define that tension stress is plus, we can think the following ijσ′ in the local (crack) coordinates system three cases according to the values of stresses ( ′ x 1 s , s ′ x 2 ① ② | | ) . ′ >′ | σμσ 22 21 ′ ≤′ | | σμσ 22 21 22 >′σ | ③ 0 where μ is friction coefficient. |, |, σ σ ≤′ 22 ≤′ 22 0 0 The case ①  is the case where the friction sliding arises between the crack faces, the case ②  is the case where the crack faces are restricted by friction force and elastic body behaves like no crack, the case ③ corresponds to the open crack. 1.1.

The Numerical Simulations by ANSYS  We have done the finite element simulations by using the model plane 13 of ANSYS  in the direction 2x  (tension for the opened crack, compression for the closed crack) is acted on the plane area 12.0 for the case that uniaxial distribution load with in the total dimension (Fig. 2). 5.0=P MPa 2m33× Initial data used at the simulation are E = 58 ,GPa ν = ,23.0 μ = ,65.0 DD = 2 1 = 2.0 , F I = F II = 1 . In the Fig. 2－4, we have shown the displacements and the stress change characteristics following the various crack parameters. As shown in figures, the displacement increases when the length of the crack is increasing. The maximum principal stress iσ and the absolute value of the minimum principal 3σ and the intensity of the stress iσ increase according to the length of crack, and stress | | when the direction angle of crack θ increases between ° 90~0 ° and then decrease. And by the calculation results we can know that the maximum, minimum principal stresses and the intensity of the stress have maximum values in the neighborhood of the crack end. Fig. 2.

We represented voids and defects etc. using damage tensor based on the concept of the effective stress and modeled the cracks on the basis of the exact crack theory. According to this modelling, we determined the stiffness characteristics quantities of the stratum material and on the basis of this analyzed the stress and the displacement of the stratum structure with the cracks and the void damage using ANSYS.
