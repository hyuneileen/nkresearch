But a loose stability theorem of fuzzy control system was not proposed. In this paper we propose and prove of a loose stability theorem of the continuous and discrete TS fuzzy system based on moving rate. Key words fuzzy reasoning, moving rate, continuous TS fuzzy system, discrete TS fuzzy system, loose stability condition  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Now it is very important and extremely urgent to accelerate the development of our science and technology.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 34 P. 148) Fuzzy system is the information processing system based on fuzzy set theory such as fuzzy modeling identification system, fuzzy diagnosis system, fuzzy predicative system, fuzzy retrieval system, fuzzy control system and so on [7－9]. Stability problem is an important problem of the practical works. Previous research [7, 8] proposed stability problem of fuzzy systems based on degree of matching-type fuzzy reasoning. In the previous papers [1, 2, 12], is presented a disadvantage of the fuzzy reasoning methods based on composition rules of fuzzy reasoning and then proposed compensation principle of the fuzzy reasoning. The characteristic improvement of fuzzy control [3, 9], fuzzy predicative modeling method [5, 6], an improvement of an reaning ability in the fuzzy neural network [9, 10], application in DDos attack detection [2, 11], research of a new recursive fuzzy reasoning method by move rate of membership function and it’s application [3] and so on, application researches were presented based on a new concept of move rate. In the previous research [1] is proposed and proved a risk stability condition of fuzzy system. But a loose stability theorem of fuzzy control system was not proposed. In this paper we propose and prove of a loose stability theorem of the continuous and discrete TS fuzzy system based on moving rate. 1. Stability Condition of the TS Fuzzy System According to parallel distributed compensation principle [4] output of a TS fuzzy controller is as follows. － 15 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 3 Juche103(2014) )( tu = ω i )( txFt )( i ω i )( t (1) r ∑ i 1 = r ∑ i 1 = Design of TS fuzzy controller is referred to solve parameter iF of formula (1).

Loose Stability Condition of the Discrete and Continuous Fuzzy System Next, let’s consider a loose stability condition. Varying formula (2), (3) is derivated formula (6), (10). In this case applying the fuzzy reasoning method based on moving rate [2, 3, 4], a new two theorems are as follows.

The continuous fuzzy system is globally asymptotically stable if there exists a common positive definite matrix P which satisfy formula (7), (8). － 16 － Improvement of a Loose Stability Theorem of TS Fuzzy System based on Moving Rate FB i i T } { A i + T PG ij + PG ij FB i + { A i G ij = APP i + { + FB i i 0} < (7) < 0 ,    i < j (8) {} + A + FB j i } j j (9) 2 Proof Let’s consider a critical function (Lyapunov function) which satisfy following 4 conditions. ① )0( V ② txV ([ = )] 0 > ,   ,0 if tx )( = 0 , ③ txV )]([ ∞→ if  , tx )( ∞→ , T = )] tx )( tPx )( txV ([ ④  Let’s consider variation of the critical function. + T )( )( txPtx ([ txV & )] = = T )( tx & & = )( tx T ′ Atdtd i i ){( )( ′ i + FB i i T } )( tPx + T )( Ptx ′ Atdtd i i ){( )( ′ i + )(} txFB i i + r ∑ i = j + )( tx T ′ )(2 i )( tdtd ′ j { A i + FB i j T } + { A + FB j i j T } )( tPx + + T )( Ptx ′ )(2 i )( tdtd ′ j { A i + FB i j {} + A + FB j i } j tx )( = 2 2 = tx )( T tdtd )( ( )[{ ′ i ′ i A i + FB i i T } APP i + { + txFB )(}] i i + + tx )( T ′ )(2 i PGtdtd ( )[ ′ j ij + PG tx )(] < 0 ij T )( tPx r ∑ i = j r ∑ i < j r ∑ i < j r ∑ i = j r ∑ i < j Since 0 on moving rate is guaranteed.

(proof end) Therefore globally asymptotical stability of the discrete TS fuzzy system based on moving Conclusion  We proposed and proved a new theorem about loose stability conditions in the continuous and discrete TS fuzzy system based on moving rate of the fuzzy reasoning method. Firstly, the condition of theorem 1 and theorem 2 in this paper is loosed the condition the condition of theorem 1 and theorem 2[1]. Namely, common positive definite matrix P which satisfy the condition of theorem satisfy the past condition [1]. In other hands, to solve a common positive definite matrix P  which satisfying the condition of theorem 1 and theorem 2 in this paper is simple than to solve a common positive definite matrix P which satisfy the condition of theorem 1 and theorem 2 in the paper [1]. Therefore to apply the condition of theorem 1 and theorem 2 in this paper is effective. Secondly, the theorem 1 and theorem 2 in this paper is a kind of robust stability condition. Because conditions of theorems guaranteed stability of fuzzy systems although there exists model error in the antecedents of fuzzy model.
