Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 3 Juche103(2014) Evaluating Method of Cell Protection Function using Photohaemolysis An Kwang Il, Kim Yong Nam Abstract Haemolysis can occur without photosensitizer when erythrocytes suspension is exposed to ultraviolet lamp (30W, maximum wavelength 250nm). If erythrocytes suspension, of which the dilution is 1：100, is put in test-tube with 40mm in diameter and put at 20cm under ultraviolet lamp, the haemolysis mainly occurs for 2 hours. Curcumin of more than 0.005% inhibits haemolysis significantly. Rhizoma curcumae and Radix salviae miltiorrhizae exhibit clear cell protection effect in the photohaemolysis system by ultraviolet irradiation and when their concentrations are 0.3 and 0.1% respectively, synergism appears. Key words erythrocyte, curcumin, photohaemolysis, cell protection, photosensitizer, Rhizoma curcumae, Radix salviae miltiorrhizae  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “Medical science should bend its energy to research on the prevention of diseases whose incidence and mortality rate are high, among them those of the cardiovascular system and cancerous diseases. It should also strive to place traditional Korean medicine on a scientific basis and combine it with modern medicine properly, prevent pollution, and increase the variety of medical supplies and appliances and improve their quality. At the same time a long-term plan should be carried out for research to advance basic medicine including virology and genetics.”(“ON THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE HEALTH SERVICE” P. 18) Radicals induced by strong light irradiation haemolyze erythrocytes, so now in some countries, evaluating methods of cell protection function of functional materials using photohaemolysis are developed and used [10, 11]. These methods are important in search of materials which have cell protection function because their material is not unstable induced chemically but alive cells, namely erythrocytes [4, 8]. But the methods used in previous studies need special devices and photosensitizer such as Rose Bengal [10] or haematophorpirin [11]. Therefore, we established photohaemolyzing method without special device or photosensitizer, and evaluated cell protection function of some plant materials by using it. 1. Materials and Methods 1.1. Materials, devices and reagents Materials Rats(Rattus norvegicus, “Wistar”, body weight (225±16)g), Rhizoma curcumae, Radix salviae miltiorrhizae, Flos lonicerae, Herba leonuri, Radix scutellariae, Cortex phellodendri. － 80 － Evaluating Method of Cell Protection Function using Photohaemolysis Devices Centrifuge(“LD4-2A”), ultraviolet lamp (30W, maximum wavelength 250nm), luxmetre(“Ю-116”), spectrophotometer (“UV-7504 Shimadzu”) Reagents Saline solution(0.85% NaCl, chemically pure), ethanol(analytically pure), curcu- min(analytically pure) 1.2. Methods Blood in carotid of rats was collected, weighed, mixed with saline solution (0.85%) which was 20～40 times of blood and centrifuged (1 000×g, 15min). Sunken erythrocytes were washed with saline solution more than 3 times. They were diluted with saline solution, which was 50 ～150 times of early blood, and shaked well to be mixed so as to become a suspension. The concentration of suspension was expressed as the ratio of blood mass (g) to diluted saline solution’s volume (mL). 3mL of erythrocytes suspension was put in each test-tube with 10～40mm in diameter, and 60μL of test solutions (90% ethanol as control) was put in it. The test tubes were put in different sunlight conditions or at different distances from ultraviolet lamp (30W, maximum wavelength 250nm) in a dark room and the change of transmittancy were measured at regular intervals. Luminous intensity of sunlight was measured with luxmetre and transmitancy was measured with spectrometer at 700nm[5]. The above experiments were done in (20±1)℃. Curcumin was used as a solution of 0.001～0.05% in 90% ethanol. Considering the characteristics of useful components, Rhizoma curcumae and Radix salviae miltiorrhizae were heated and extracted for more than 2 hours in ethanol (more than 80%) and extra materials in water. Then the extracted solution was filtrated and concentrated to become fluid extract of which 1mL contained 1g of medicinal material. Cell protection function of medicinal materials was evaluated by modificated method of references [10, 11] (See 2.2.) 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Influence of some factors on photohaemolysis It is important to select properly the kind of light source in inducing photohaemolysis.[10, 11] After 3mL of erythrocytes suspension was added with 60μL of ethanol and put in different light conditions, the change of transmittancy was investigated at a regular interval. The result was as follows (table 1). If erythrocytes are haemolyzed, the membrane is destroyed, so the transmittancy of suspension increases. As shown in table 1, the trans- mittancy hardly changed in dark or sunlight condition. Namely eryth- rocytes were hardly haemolyzed. When the suspension was exposed to ultraviolet lamp, the transmittancy changed significantly according to the increase of exposed time, which Table 1.

Generally the shorter the wavelength of light is, the bigger the energy of photon is [3]. In previous studies, fluorescent lamp [10] or ultraviolet lamp (maximum wavelength 370nm)[11] was used as light source and photosensitizer was used, but we used ultraviolet lamp of which maximum wavelength was 250nm, so we could induce haemolysis without photosensitizer. In table 1’s condition, the haemolysis didn’t end for 4 hours. In order to decrease haemolysis time, the change of transmittancy was investigated according to different concentrations of erythrocytes suspension put 30cm below ultraviolet lamp (table 2). Before irradiation Concentration of suspension Table 2. The change of transmittancy according to the concentration of erythrocytes suspension The transmittancy according to irradiation time/% 1h As shown in table 2, the transmittancy became to nearly saturated state for 3 hours when the concentration of erythrocytes suspension was 1/100～1/150. Namely the haemolysis occurred for about 3 hours. The concentration of erythrocytes suspension was set as 1/100 because the high be- ginning transmittancy is unfavourable for correct observation of haemolysis process. Then, in order to evaluate the in- fluence of ultraviolet irradiation amount on haemolysis, suspension was put in testtubes of different diameter, then at different distances below ultraviolet lamp and the change of transmittancy according to exposed time was investigated (table 3).

Namely when the diameter of irradiation surface was 10mm, the transmittancy became saturated state after 3 hours, but when the diameter was 40mm, it became saturated state after 2.0～2.5 hours. So if the erythrocytes suspension was put in test tubes with 40mm in diameter and put at 10～20cm below ultraviolet lamp, the main haemolysis process would be observed for 2 hours. － 82 － Evaluating Method of Cell Protection Function using Photohaemolysis 2.2. Evaluating method of cell protection function using photohaemolysis In previous studies[10], semi-haemolysis time, namely the time for which half of erythrocytes was haemolzed, was used as indicator for evaluation of cell protection ability by photohaemolysis. If haemolysis inhibiter was added to photohaemolysis system, the haemolysis delays, so the measuring time becomes longer and the number of measurement increases. In order to overcome these deficiencies, we introduced new indicator based on transmittancy and evaluated cell protection ability of materials. Generally, the change of transmittancy according to ultraviolet irradiation time in erythrocytes suspension appears as S-type curve as shown in the below Fig. In both control and test divisions, the beginning and end values of transmittancy were almost same. The beginning value is transmittancy when erythrocytes are not haemolyzed at all and the end value is that when erythrocytes are entirely haemolyzed. If these values are represented by T0 and T100 respectively and the transmittancy of any division at any time is represented by T, the haemolysis rate (percentage of haemolyzed eryth- rocytes to beginning erythrocytes, %) could be calculated by the following formula. H = TT − 0 × T T − 100 0 100 Fig. Change of transmittancy of erythrocytes suspension according to irradiation time 1－control, 2－test 1, 3－test 2 Generally, the haemolysis is done in control division for the first time, so the saturated value of the control transmittancy can become T100. Then when the haemolysis rates would be compared becomes a problem. If the rates are compared at t1 in Fig., the difference between test divisions is not clear, and if they are compared at t3, the haemolysis inhibiting effect doesn’t appear in test 1 division. The most suitable measuring time is t2 when the transmittancy of control becomes saturated state or just before it. Then the haemolysis inhibiting effect of test divisions appears clearly and the difference between test divisions becomes clearer. When erythrocytes suspension (concentration 1/100) is put in test-tube with 40mm in diameter and at 20cm below ultraviolet lamp, the haemolysis measuring time (t2) might be 2h (table 3). On the other hand, haemolysis inhibiting ability (IH) was newly introduced in addition to haemolysis rate as index for evaluation of cell protection function. IH = H Control H Test Using the above established method, the cell protection ability of curcumin, the main component of turmeric pigment which has already been known as cell protection substance[1, 2], was evaluated and the result was shown in table 4. In 0.005～0.05% of curcumin, the haemolysis rate was 42.6～80.4%, which showed clear － 83 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 3 Juche103(2014) Table 4.

However, in the future, it should be studied more how the haemolysis process would be changed using ultraviolet lamps with different wavelength and luminous intensity, and what relationship this method has with the evaluating methods using photosensitizer. 2.3. Cell protection ability of several plant materials Using the above established method, cell protection ability of 6 species of plant materials[5－ 7, 9] was evaluated and compared (table 5). Table 5.

There are many cases when plant materials exhibit better effect if they are used together than if they are used alone[5]. So, cell protection ability was investigated when Rhizoma curcumae of 0.3% was added with Radix salviae miltiorrhizae and Radix scutellariae of 0.05～0.1% respectively (table 6). If Rhizoma curcumae was added with Radix salviae miltiorrhizae or Radix scutellariae, the value of haemolysis inhibiting ability increased more. Especially, it was considerable that haemolysis inhibiting ability increased more than 3 times if Rhizoma curcumae 0.3% was added with Radix salviae miltiorrhizae 0.1%. Using the above synergism, medicinal materials which exhibit high cell protection effect would be manufactured even though a little plant material is used. － 84 － Evaluating Method of Cell Protection Function using Photohaemolysis Table 6.

Conclusion  Haemolysis can occur without photosensitizer when erythrocytes suspension is exposed to ultraviolet lamp (30W, maximum wavelength 250nm). If erythrocytes suspension, of which the dilution is 1:100, is put in test-tube with 40mm in diameter and put at 20cm under ultraviolet lamp, the haemolysis mainly occurs for 2 hours. The cell protection function of materials can be compared and evaluated with calculation of haemolysis rate of every division when the transmittancy of control division gets to saturation state. Curcumin of more than 0.005% inhibits haemolysis significantly. Rhizoma curcumae and Radix salviae miltiorrhizae exhibit clear cell protection effect in the photohaemolysis system by ultraviolet irradiation and when their concentrations are 0.3 and 0.1% respectively, synergism appears.
