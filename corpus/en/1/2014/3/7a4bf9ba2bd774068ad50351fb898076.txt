Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 3 Juche103(2014) Detection Method for Potato Brown Rot and  Ring Rot by PCR Ri Won Jin Abstract The specific primers for detection of pathogenic bacteria causing potato disease such as Brown rot and Ring rot with the amplification of ribosomal sequences by PCR were designed and synthesized and optimum PCR detection condition was elucidated. The method of nucleic acid extraction for detection of diseases by bacteria in potato was selected and the detection limitation of bacterial DNA was elucidated. This result can be applied to the production of non-disease potato. Key words potato, bacterial diseases, PCR, primer  Introduction  Potato is subjected to diseases of various kinds. In potato, several bacterial diseases cause serious yield losses and grow obstacles. Brown rot is caused by the Ralstonia solanacearum and ring rot is caused by the Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedoncus [2, 3, 6]. As these diseases are the main limiting factor, the production decrease rate by it is high as 50% [1]. worldwide [9]. them [4]. At present, no effective agrochemicals exist for control the potato bacterial diseases in the So, the early detection by means of sensitive diagnostic methods is the main way to control There are several detection methods such as symptom observation, nucleic acid amplification and immunologic assay. PCR is one of reasonable method [5]. Therefore, we researched the detection method for rapid and exact diagnosis of bacterial disease in potato by using PCR. 1. Materials and Method 1.1. Materials Potato tubers showing clear symptoms and pathogenic bacteria strains causing brown rot and ring rot which are isolated, identified and stored before, were used in experiment. 1.2. Reagents and experimental instruments The MgSO4·7H2O, K2HPO4, Tris-HCl, DNeasy Plant Mini Qiagen Kit, Tris-HCl, BSA, EDTA, SDS, CTAB, NaCl and etc. were used as reagents. PCR Engine, thermostat, water bath, incubator, vortex mixer, micro-centrifuge, gel dock, electrophoresis apparatus, micro-pipette and etc. were used as instruments. － 108 － Detection Method for Potato Brown Rot and Ring Rot by PCR 1.3. Methods Nucleotide sequences of relative bacteria were collected from NCBI data base. By using design software “Primer Designer 4(version 4.20)”, the specific primer for detection of pathogenic bacteria causing potato diseases with the amplification by PCR were designed and synthesized from 16S rRNA sequences for brown rot, and from 16S-23S rRNA & 23S rRNA sequences for ring rot, respectively [7, 8, 10]. PCR conditions with these primers were established using the standard procedure [11, 12].  2. Results and Discussion First of all, we have designed the specific primers to potato bacterial wilt. By surveying the complete sequence of pathogenic bacteria Ralstonia solanacearum, causal agent of potato bacterial wilt, we selected species-specific sequences from brown rot 16S ribosomal RNA genes, and designed the primer pairs from these sequences. When we performed BLAST explorer on designed primer pairs using software DNA Star, satisfactory results were obtained. As a result, the designed brown rot specific primer pairs for PCR detection and the characteristics are shown in table 1. When using designed primer pairs, the products size of PCR is 286bp. Table 1.

In the case of ring rot, we selected the 16S ribosomal genes and 23S ribosomal genes sequences as design regions. Design methods are same as in the case of brown rot. In the case of ring rot, PCR product was 214bp(table 2). Table 2.

As an experimental result, the suitable annealing temperature and time in brown rot were When amplified 30 cycles, the best products were obtained by adding the 250nmol/L of each primer and 200μmol/L dNTPs to PCR solutions respectively. In the case of ring rot, suitable annealing condition was to perform 30 cycles of PCR, keeping the temperature of 62℃ for 60s. The concentrations of primers and dNTPs were same as in the brown rot. － 109 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 3 Juche103(2014) The composition of PCR solution which we have studied was shown in table 3.

Performance of post-enrichment culture of bacterial before PCR is an important way to increase the detection sensitivity. Through post-enrichment procedure, we can detect brown rot and ring rot at concentrations of 103CFU/mL respectively (Fig. 1 and 2). Through above research, we have established the PCR detection methods on brown rot and ring rot of potato. － 110 － Detection Method for Potato Brown Rot and Ring Rot by PCR Fig.1.
