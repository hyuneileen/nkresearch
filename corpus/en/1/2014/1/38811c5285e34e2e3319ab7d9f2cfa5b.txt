Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 1 Juche103(2014) Dependence of Integral Intensity on Line Broadening  in Powder Diffraction Pattern Jo Kwang Won, Rim Chun Ryop, Pak Chol Min and Jang Jong Su Abstract Relation of integral intensity in powder diffraction pattern to volume integration of intensity in reciprocal space is presented. The integral intensity in powder diffraction pattern is different quantity from the volume integration of intensity in reciprocal space. Though the volume integrations of intensity are constant in reciprocal space, the integral intensities in powder diffraction pattern are different if line broadenings are different. The smaller integral intensity is obtained from the greater broadening. It is called as dependence of integral intensity on the line broadening. The volume integration of intensity in reciprocal space is proportional to the product of the integral intensity and the variance of line profile in powder diffraction pattern, not to integral intensity only. It implies that size-profile, Fourier transform, integral intensity, maximum intensity, integral breadth and variance have new meanings. Size distribution data of CeO2 powder sample obtained from integral breadth and variance of new meanings shows a good agreement with TEM data. Key words dependency on breading, integral intensity, powder diffraction pattern  Introduction  Line profile (LP) is given by intensity versus reciprocal space variable s, )(sI , in powder diffraction pattern(PDP) and integral intensity (II) is defined as When intensity versus vector s is )(sJ ∞− in reciprocal space, volume integral intensity (VII) I = )( sI ds (1) ∞ ∫ is obtained by J ∫= J )( dv s (2) * where *dv is the volume element in reciprocal space. In the previous research[12, 13] relation between I and J is known as I =                 (3) J From this we obtained )(sI as dJ ds and its Fourier transform (FT) as the common volume between crystallite and its “ghost”. The common volume model of FT is continually used ever in the previous research[10, 11]. It is known that II is constant if the total volumes of crystallites in powder samples are constant and it is independent of average size of crystallites. Experimental examination, whether it is right or not, has not been reported because nobody － 76 － Dependence of Integral Intensity on Line Broadening in Powder Diffraction Pattern has doubted about it. However, we have observed several times the fact that the smaller II is obtained from the greater line broadening (LB) though volume compositions of crystalline phase are constant. It makes for us to doubt about accuracy of equation (3). In this paper, we consider the relation between I and J in a new viewpoint. It depends on . We confine here to the ideal condition in which powder sample relation between and )(sJ )(sI is not oriented and LP is obtained as physical profile without instrumental broadening. Starting from the new relation between I and J , physical meanings of size-profile , FT, II, maximum intensity (MI), integral breadth (IB) and variance [16] will be considered again. The result is evaluated by size distribution analysis of the powder sample CeO2 data [3]. 1. LB-Dependence of II 1.1. Relation between I and J If is LP of a single particle, )(sI )(sI )( sI is given by [4]. ) se = J ( (4) where se is direction vector fixed in reciprocal space.  is LP of the single particle, not of powder sample. Someone may )(sI is LP of powder sample, but equation (4) is satisfied for single particle. It is important that )(sI doubt equation (4) if Even in the previous research[8], who pointed out that Bragg’s equation was not exact, introduced equation (4) for single particle. By using equation (4) in equation (1), II is obtained as where *dl is the length element on the line s = se I = ( sJ e ) ds = (5) ∫ s = *)( dl s J e s in reciprocal space. I is the line integration, not the volume integration in reciprocal space. I has different meaning from J in reciprocal space.

J is proportional to the product of II and the variance, not to only II. I and J are different quantities for the single particle. II and VII of powder sample are obtained by summation of particles, respectively.  is spherical symmetry, equation (6) is also satisfied for powder sample, because IIs )(sJ If － 77 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) of powder sample. It is important that of all the particles are the same and VIIs, too. Furthermore, equation (5) must be also satisfied for  is for powder sample, not for single particle. )(sJ )(sJ must be fixed for the given diffraction system and it is independent Mapping from )(sI of the same sample, equation (5) holds always true. of what the sample is. For )(sI is spherical symmetry though individual particle is If powder sample is not oriented, and to )(sJ )(sJ )(sJ not, and then equation (6) is satisfied. In this case, we can also say that equation (4) holds true for the powder sample. It is not discussed here. II and VII are different quantities for powder sample, too. 1.2. LB-dependence of II  J is proportional to the volumes of crystallites [5] and it is constant independent of average size of crystallites if the total volume is constant in powder sample. Therefore, constant quantity 2σ . This is not I but the product of I and 2σ in PDP. The smaller II is obtained from the greater implies that II is not constant. It is called as LB-dependence of II. It can not be obtained from the classical theories of powder diffraction. 2. Some Characteristic Parameters of Size Profile 2.1. Size profile Size profile is represented by diffraction of particles with homogenous electron density [8]. Diffraction intensity of homogenous density particle is written as [5] ∫ is the common volume between the particle and “ghost” shifted as t . where symmetry for the spherical particle and intensity of powder sample is proportional to (8) is spherical  in )(sJ )( etV )(tV )(sJ )( sJ dt = − istπ2 reciprocal space.

For the powder sample with size distribution density, p(D), FT is obtained as ϕ )( t = )( DDP ( 5 23 − 5 tD 32 + 5 tD − t 5 ) dD .

We think that the reason is in its wrong meaning. It can be used as well as IB in LB analysis by using equation (18). / D <> D < > < < . － 79 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) 2.4. “Hook effect” From equation (13) if derivative of )(tϕ in t=0 ′ϕ )0( = 0 (19) is obtained. It is known as “hook effect” [2, 13]. In the previous research[15] “hook effect” was in principle impossible and only should be due to wrong data. But, “hook effect” is essential from the definition of FT. It means there is something problem in Fourier analysis of size profile based on )0(´ ≠ϕ [13]. 0 Thus, the new consideration obtained from the broadening-dependence of II shows that LB analysis must be reexamined. 3. Size Distribution Analysis by IB and Variance 3.1. Principle From IB and variance, / D distribution can be obtained. For example, <> D < > < nD < and > D <> is given by / D 6 5 5 3 > are obtained and size n < D >=< D > 1( + c ) n ( 2 n − n 2) [9].

Size distribution analysis of CeO2 The presented method has been examined by size distribution analysis of CeO2 data[3]. The result shows in Fig. with TEM data[1]. Though P(D) has been obtained directly from IB and variance without repeating calculation, the result shows a good agreement with TEM data. － 80 － Fig. Size distribution of CeO2 1－TEM data 2－IB+Variance Dependence of Integral Intensity on Line Broadening in Powder Diffraction Pattern Conclusion  II and VII are not same quantities: I is the line integration in reciprocal space and J is proportional to the product of II and variance in PDP. It is obtained from the relation between LP and intensity  is intensity at a point in reciprocal space, distribution in reciprocal space. It is obvious that when is physical profile of the sample with intensity distribution as )(sJ )(sI )(sI . J Classical theories, which assert I = , must be reexamined. In the previous research[8] size profiles of a single spherical crystallite and powder sample of spherical crystallites with same size were different. However, if spherical particles have really homogenous density of electron, powder sample has the same LP with a single particle. According to the previous research[8], size profile of crystalline powder sample is not obtained from the homogenous density particles. We proved that size profile of powder sample of spherical crystallites with same diameters equals to LP of a single particle with the same diameter and homogenous density of electron. It will be shown in another paper. II depends on LB though VII is constant. Exact theory of powder diffraction must explain LB-dependence of II, “hook effect” and other new properties. Details will be discussed in following papers. FT of size profile has other form than classical. Then intensity and broadening parameters have the new physical meanings. perfectly. All the results contradict to the classical concepts but exactness of the new results can be proved Good agreement of our analytical data and TEM data means that our viewpoint is not wrong.
