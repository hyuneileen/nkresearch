Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 1 Juche103(2014) Distribution and the Excretion Properties of Radioactive 137Cs and 90Sr in Mouse(Mus nusculus) by the Oral Chitosan Adsorbent Kim Song Ho, Ko Hyong Bong Abstract The adsorbents mixed chitosan and natural materials as the eliminants of radioactive materials absorbed into the body have been developed. 137Cs and 90Sr absorbed into the body of the white mouse could be remarkably excreted by the oral adsorbents of chitosan and the distribution of the radioactive materials in body has been found. Key words chitosan，strontium, cesium, separation Introduction It is especially important to give studies to ward off damage by radiations and radioactive isotopes because radioactive isotopes in different fields of the national economy have been widely using recently, and in particularly. The radioactive 137Cs may distributes homogeneously to the tissues and organs of human body since it is similar to chemical behavior of sodium and potassium after its intake, and the radioactive 90Sr may occur the inner irradiation for a long time, depositing to bone. Materials that make a most effective excretion of the radioactive 137Cs in human body are known to ferric hexacyanoferrate(Ⅲ) (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3), activated charcoal etc. and excretive materials of the radioactive 90Sr have been using complex formative reagents, such as citric acid and mono-sodium glutamate, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane (18-crown-6), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid, ethylenglycol-bis-(13-amino-ethyl- ether)-N, N' tetraacetic acid, cyclohexane-diaminetetraacetic acid and diethylentriaminepenta acetic acidsodium arginate, diuretics and activated charcoal etc[2, 5]. Recently chitin and chitosan are taken note as eliminant, radiological protectant and adsorbent of heavy metals and radioactive materials[1－9]. Oral adsorbents combined chitosan with inorganic adsorbents as eliminants of the radioactive 137Cs and 90Sr absorbed in body have not been used so far. In this paper the distribution and the excretion properties of radioactive 137Cs and 90Sr in mouse by the oral adsorbent combined chitosan with bentonite have been discussed. － 53 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) Experimental Method  The white mice(Mus nusculus) weighed (20±2)g as experimental animals to investigate the excretion properties of radioactive materials have used. There were 6 white mice in each control group and each experimental group and experiment in each group proceeded with 3 times. Quantities of the daily feed and water for the white mice in all groups have been fixed. Quantities of the daily excrement in a mouse(0.16±0.06g) are little difference in the control groups and the experimental groups. The floor of all mice cages was made of the lattice to collect their urine and feces and the excrement was collected on filter papers under the wire cages. 137CsNO3 and 90Sr(NO3)2 solution, ～5·104 pulse·min-1·mL-1 in specific radioactivity, were used as the radioactive materals. The volumn of an injection for a white mouse was 0.2 mL. The oral chitosan adsorbent was made from dissolving chitosan with 75～80 percent of its deacetalation degree and 60～120 thousand of its molecular weight in 1mol/L CH3COOH solution and mixing bentonite in it. After in the control groups 0.2mL of the radioactive solution has been got an oral injection the inside of white mices’ stomach and constant time went on, radioactivity of each tissues and excrement was measured. Meanwhile after in the experimental groups 0.5mL of the adsorbent solution has been got an oral injection inside of their stomach for a day or a few days and subsequently 0.2mL of the radioactive solution has been got a oral injection, radioactivity of each tissues and excrement was measured at constant intervals. Dry excrement was made fine powder, 1g of it was put on the plate, and then radioactivity of excrement was measured by the counting equipment with the counting tube “СБТ-13”. Back-radioactivity was measured, getting dry the filter paper deposited the radioactive solution of volumn of an injection or the 1g of excrement mixed with it. The radioactive distribution in each tissues of white mouse was determined by the measurement of its radioactivity after radioactive solution has been got a oral injection and then the tissues have been seperated, incinerated and ground after 24 hours. The measurement time was selected as 0.01 of relative error.  Result and Discussion  The rate of remaining and excrement of the radioactive substance in white mouse as a function of the time elasped were shown in table 1. As shown in table 1, after the radioactive 137Cs was got a oral injection, it was excreted rapidly for a day and then was decreased in proportion to the time elapsed. － 54 － Distribution and the Excretion Properties of Radioactive 137Cs and 90Sr in Mouse(Mus nusculus) … 137 1 Table 1.

As shown in Fig. 1, in the control group got independently an oral injection of radioactive 90Sr, 80% of the injected quantities was excreted for 3 days and the rest was decreased slowly. After 7 days, the injected radioactive material was remained about 5 percent extent. Meanwhile, in the groups got a injection of the oral chitosan adsorbent, 90% of the radioactive material was excreted for 2 days and 3% of it was remained after 7 days. Also, after the adsorbent solution has been got an injection a day for 5 days continuously, in case of the injection of the radioactive material the higher excrement appeared. At that time the radioactive material was excreted more than 90% for 2 days and about 1% extent of it was remained after 7 days. It is shown that the low-molecular chitosan may take effect on the elimination of the radioactive 90Sr in the enteron and in particular the pre-intake of chitosan may decrease markedly the remaining rate of the radioactive material in body. Fig. 1. The remaining rate of 90Sr as a function of the time elasped 1－Control group, 2, 3－ In case of pre-injection of adsorbent solution a day and 5 days After the oral chitosan adsorbent has been got an oral injection a day for 5 days, the excrement rate of the radioactive 90Sr in the urine(Fig. 2) and the feces(Fig. 3) was very high just after the radioactive material was got an oral injection. The value (U/F), the ratios the excrement rate in feces to the excrement rate in urine, is 0.7 in the control groups but is 0.16~0.21 in the experimental groups after 2 days. It is shown that the oral chitosan adsorbent accelerates the excrement of the radioactive material so it adsorbs the radioactive 90Sr and makes the low absorption in the enteron. And the higher concentration of chitosan is, the higher excrement of the radioactive material is. The fact that the oral chitosan adsorbent makes the low aborption of the radioactive 90Sr in the enteron may also appear in the distribution of radioactivity in body(Table 2). As shown in table 2, most of the radioactive 90Sr deposit on the bone in the control group. But in the experimental group it deposits 3～5 times lower than one in the control group. The radioactive material has been got an oral injection in white mice and then the distribution of the radioactive 137Cs in each tissues after 1 days were listed in table 3. － 55 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) Fig. 2.

We have discussed that the radioactive 90Sr in body was distributed mainly in its bone and the radioactive 137Cs was distributed homogeneously in all organs. － 56 － Distribution and the Excretion Properties of Radioactive 137Cs and 90Sr in Mouse(Mus nusculus) … References [1] Ruey-Shin Juang et al.; Water Research, 36, 2999, 2002.
