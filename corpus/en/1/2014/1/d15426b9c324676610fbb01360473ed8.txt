We calculate the coefficient with varying the frequency till 50GHz, incident angle is 30, 60°, and compared with the precedence results[1－6]. Key words electromagnetic wave, reflection coefficient.  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Research work for introducing atomic energy into production should be carried out under a far-reaching programme. Radioisotopes and radiation should be widely applied in various fields, including industry and agriculture.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 15 P. 197) The problem of conclusion for propagating electromagnetic wave’s reflection coefficient by the low-temperature plasma is important task in consideration of the reflection and absorption at the atmosphere plasma. There are many experimental methods to conclusion of reflection coefficients with the density of plasma. We divided the plasma slab into number of sub plasma slabs and found total reflection coefficient by reflection coefficient in each slabs. 1．A Method of Reflection Coefficient Conclusion  To determinate reflection coefficient for electromagnetic wave propagate through the plasma generated nearby the metal surface; we divided the plasma slab into n layers. In each layers, the electron number densities are assumed constant. The external magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, the polarization direction of E is vertical to the xoy plane[4]. As shown in Fig. 1, the magnetized plasma slab is divided. The element of the permittivity tensor in the lth layer are noted as l1ε , l2ε as Fig. 1. In the lth layer, the total magnetic field is the sum of the reflected and incident components[1]. y ik ik x − ik x lx H + lz Substituting of (1) into eA l = eB l ×∇ ( lx ) y e i εωε0 rl H l = (1) ⋅ E l , we can － 64 － Fig. 1.

Conclusion  In this paper, we suggest the model to calculate the reflection coefficient when electromagnetic wave through the plasma nearby the metal surface. We calculate the coefficient with vary the frequency till 50GHz, incident angle is 90° and then 30, 60°. Thus our model is corrected by experimental results. － 66 － Reflection Coefficient for Electromagnetic Wave Propagation through the Plasma Generated Nearby … References [1] R. J.
