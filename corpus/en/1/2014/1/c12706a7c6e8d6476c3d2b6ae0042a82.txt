Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 1 Juche103(2014) Algorithm of Configuration Control of Redundant Manipulators  under the Constructional Joint Limit Kim Pyong Hui Abstract We consider the configuration control of kinetically redundant robot manipulators. We proposed the algorithm for joint limit avoidance(JLA) using configuration control approach which makes redundant manipulator possible to carry out not only the main task but also the joint limit avoidance. Key words kinetically redundant manipulators, configuration control, joint limit avoidance  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Today scientists and technicians are faced with a very important task. They must forge ahead more energetically with scientific research work in order to make a great contribution to raising the scientific and technological level of the country to a higher stage and developing the national economy at a rapid pace.”( “KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 37 P. 359) Particular attention has been devoted to the study of the redundant robot manipulators, because these are utilized in performing tasks that require dexterity comparable to that of the human arm. There are some drawbacks associated with the pseudo-inverse method [2]. By this method extra degrees of the redundant manipulators are not applied to the user-defined additional tasks. The other alternative is presented in the extended Jacobian method [3] where the dimension of the additional task space is equal to the degree of the redundancy. In this method the dimension of the additional task should be equal to the degree of redundancy and it is not applicable for the additional tasks such as obstacle avoidance that are not active for all time. We proposed the algorithm for JLA using configuration control approach [1] which makes redundant manipulator possible to carry out not only the main task but also the JLA. 1. Configuration Control Method A manipulator is said to be redundant when it has a number of degrees of mobility which is greater than the number of variables that are necessary to describe a given task. Let us denote the dimension of the joint space n , and the dimension of the task space m .  is the degree of redundancy. mn > , and mn −= r Then a manipulator is kinetically redundant when The forward kinetic function is defined as x = )(qf (1) where q is the ( ×n )1 vector of the joint space, and x is the ( ×m )1 vector of the task space. The differential kinetics equation of manipulator is given by － 9 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) ( nm × ) Jacobian, and it can be viewed as a linear mapping from nR into mR ; x & qJ e= & (2) is mapped into mRX ∈& . Two fundamental subspaces associated with a linear transformation are null space and range where eJ is the nRq ∈& the vector space(Fig. 1). The null space denoted ( eJN ) is the subspace of nR defined by n ( qJRq JN e ∈= & & The range denoted {) ) | ( eJR = 0} (3) e is a subspace of mR defined by ( JR e {) = | RqqJ & ∈ & e n } (4) Equation (3) underlies the mathematical basis for redundant manipulator. For redundant manipulator, the dimension of , where m′ is the rank of ) is equal to ′− mn ) ( Fig. 1. Geometric representation of null space and range of eJ ( eJN the matrix eJ . If eJ has full rank, then the dimension of , referred to as internal , do not produce any end-effector velocity in the given manipulator is equal to the degree of redundancy. The joint velocities belonging to joint motion and denoted by Nq& posture. This shows the major advantage of redundant manipulators. In a word, the dimension of  can be ( eJN specified without affecting the task space velocities. This gives the possibility to advantageously exploit the redundant degrees for a redundant manipulator. Therefore it is possible to achieve not only the main task for the end-effector position and orientation but also the additional tasks. is equal to the degree of redundancy and the joint velocities belonging to ( eJN ( eJN ( eJN ) ) ) ) For a given x& , a solution q& is selected which exactly satisfies equation (2). Most of the methods are based on the pseudo-inverse method [2]. That is q & += e xJ (5) where + eJ denotes the pseudo-inverse of the matrix eJ . If eJ has full rank, its pseudo-inverse is given by 1) − + = e T e T e JJ e The ability of the pseudo-inverse to provide the solution in the least-squares whether equation (2) is underspecified, square, or over-specified makes it the most attractive technique in redundancy resolution. However there are some drawbacks associated with this solution. (6) J J ( The solution given by equation (5) does not guarantee generation of joint motions which avoid singular configurations in which eJ is no longer full ranks. In the neighborhood of a singular, eJ has rank deficient, and there exist small velocities in the task space corresponding to the large velocities in the joint space. － 10 － Algorithm of Configuration Control of Redundant Manipulators under the Constructional Joint Limit Another problem with the pseudo-inverse approach is that the joint motions generated by this approach do not preserve the repeatability and cyclicity condition, i.e., a closed path in Cartesian space may not result in a closed path in joint space. The final difficulty is that the extra degrees ( ) are not utilized to satisfied dim( dim( ) q > x ) user-defined additional tasks. To overcome above problems the extended Jacobian method is presented [3]. The Jacobian of the augmented task is defined by J A = J J ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ e c ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ (7) ( nm × ) and ( nr × ) Jacobian where AJ is the extended Jacobian matrix, eJ and cJ being the matrices of the main and additional tasks respectively.

The dimension of the additional task should be equal to the degree of redundancy which makes the approach not applicable for additional tasks such as obstacle avoidance that are not active for all time. The extended Jacobian AJ becomes rank deficient if either of matrices eJ or cJ is singular, or there is a conflict between the main and additional tasks(which translates into linear dependence of the rows of eJ and cJ ). Therefore the solution of Equation (8) based on the inverse of the extended Jacobian AJ may result in instability near a singular configuration. They proposed a singular robust and the task prioritized formulation in which the drawbacks associated with the pseudo-inverse and the extended Jacobian methods are overcome [1]. ]1) × main task vector x is augmented + km ( ×m )1 [( by the Under configuration control, the  additional task vector z . )1 ( ×k The augmented task vector is defined by Τ y = [ x Τ , ΤΤ ] z .

In all cases the presence of r r velocities.  2. Description of Algorithm for the Additional Task-JLA We consider the additional task for JLA. The joint limits are presented as a set of inequality constraints. If all the computed values of the joint variables satisfy the inequalities, the redundancy can be used for other tasks. However if one or more of these inequalities are violated, the JLA secondary task should be activated. This task is defined as follows; z z i d i = q i = q im ⎫ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪⎭ (12) imq replaces either the maximum or the minimum values of the joints for where and the corresponding constraint Jacobian is defined by the equation: i = ,2,1 L , n , z ∂ i q ∂ where ie is the ith column of the identity matrix. = J c i = e T i (13) region. When the inequality constraint is inactive, the corresponding weight For smooth incorporation of the main and additional tasks, it is desirable to define a “buffer” icW is zero, and on entering the “buffer” region increases gradually to its maximum value. The algorithm to select this weight can be given as follows: = τ ,0 ≤ − q q W c i qWW = ( − q 0 c i i max + ),2/() ττ q i max τ ≤− q ≤ q i i max (14) i max i i max where 0W and τ are constants representing the coefficient for the weight and width of the buffer region respectively. c i i i WW = 0 ,2/ q > q － 12 － Algorithm of Configuration Control of Redundant Manipulators under the Constructional Joint Limit 3.
