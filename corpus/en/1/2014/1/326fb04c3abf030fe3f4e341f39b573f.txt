Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 1 Juche103(2014) Detection of Antigen and Antibody using IgG Fc Linked Hemoagglutination (IFLHA) Ryo Hyok, Pyon Yong Mi Abstract After refrigeration-fusion of macrophage in mouse ascites, IgG Fc receptor (FcR) on the surface of macrophage is linked to glutaraldehydized sheep red blood cell. Antigen or antibody is detected by reaction between FcR linked to glutaraldehydized sheep red blood cell and antigen-antibody complexes. This method has high specificity and sensitivity. Key words antigen, antibody, detection, IgG FC linked hemoagglutination  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Our scientists must study subjects which relate to the situation in our country and endeavour to create things which are needed by our people.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 19 P. 338) There are many diagnosis methods for animal infectious diseases such as ELISA, fluorescent antibody test, neutralization test, precipitation test, hemoagglutination[4－6]. These methods are based to prove specific reaction between antigen and immunogloblin Fab. Immuno-adherence hemoagglutination (IAHA) is based on the principle that antigen-antibody complexes are linked to C3b receptor on the surface of animal’s white blood cell or primates’s erythrocyte. It needs human’s blood cell and guinea pig’s serum[1, 2, 7]. Until now there are no studies on antigen-antibody reaction using linkage between Fc receptor on the surface of macrophage or B cell and antigen-antibody complexes[3]. We studied new method to detect antigen or antibody by reaction between Fc receptor on the surface of refrigeration-fusion macrophage and antigen-antibody complexes.(Fc receptor is linked to glutaraldehydized sheep red blood cell) 1. Materials and Methods 1.1. Materials Sheep red blood cell, macrophage in white mouse ascites, antigen(RHDV, CSFV, IBDV), specific antibody corresponding to certain antigen, 12～15g mouse are used. 1.2. Methods 1.2.1. Aldehydization of sheep red blood cell Sheep red blood cell (SRBC) was fixed and aldehydized by glutaraldehyde[1, 2]. － 117 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) 1.2.2. Refrigeration-fusion of mouse ascites macrophage 3% starch solution was injected into mouse abdomen by 0.5mL per a head. After 24 hours, ascites was obtained. It was centrifuged and washed with physiological salt water and diluted as 107～108 cells per a milliliter. This solution was refrigerated and fused 30 times in liquid-nitrogen and its centrifugal upper-liquid was used to linkage. 1.2.3. Linkage of macrophage FcR to aldehydized SRBC 1mL of aldehydized 10% SRBC (pH 8.0) is mixed with 1mL of refrigeration-fusion macrophage and reacted at 18～20℃ or 37～38℃ for 1～2h. Then the mixed solution was centrifuged with physiological salt water 3～4 times. After that, precipitation is diluted with PBS solution as 1% and used to detection of antigen or antibody. 1.2.4. Reaction method For detection of antigen, antigen is diluted in series in micro plate and the same amount as antigen of antibody is dropped in each hole of it. After reaction for 20 or 30min at 18～20℃ or 37℃ incubator, 1% linked FcR–SRBC(the amount is same as antigen ) was dropped in each hole. After 1～2 hours at 18～20℃ or 37℃, the result is estimated. The index is formation of agglutination. For detection of antibody, antibody is diluted in series in micro plate and same amount of antigen is dropped. The remained procedure is same as antigen detection.  2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Optimal condition for linkage SRBC to FcR 2.1.1. The rational rate for linkage SRBC to refrigeration-fusion macrophage After different amount of SRBC was mixed with refrigeration-fusion macrophage of different protein concentration equally, the sensitivity of reaction was investigated (Table 1).

The suitable pH for linkage SRBC to refrigeration-fusion macrophage The sensitivity of specific agglutination was investigated under different pH condition, after 10% aldehydized SRBC were mixed with 0.04% of protein concentration refrigeration-fusion macrophage (Table 2).

The rational temperature and time for linkage SRBC to refrigeration-fusion macrophage Under the condition of different temperature and time, the sensitivity of specific reaction was investigated after linkage SRBC to refrigeration- fusion macrophage FcR (Table 3). Table 3 shows that linkage temperature and time are 2h at 18～22℃ and 1h at 28～30℃ or 37～38℃ respectively. Table 3.

Specificity and sensitivity of IgG Fc receptor Linked Hemoagglutination (IFLHA) 2.2.1. Specificity After specific or cross-reaction of different antigen and antibody, the specificity was investigated.(Table 4) Table 4. Specificity of IFLHA Antigen Antibody RHDV CSFV IBDV － － － ＋ ＋ － RHDV ＋ － CSFV － IBDV Table 4 shows that IFLHA has very specificity because antigen only reacts on the certain antibody specially, not cross-reaction. 2.2.2. Sensitivity Sensitivity of IFLHA was compared with several serological tests, the result is as following (Table 5). Table 5.

That is, it shows that IFLHA has high sensitivity. － 119 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) 2.3. Discussion There are many serological tests to detect antigen-antibody and diagnose infectious diseases. According to methods, sensitivity, specificity, rapidity and simplify, equipments, instruments and reagents of test are different. There is no study on serological test by using the principle that Fc of antigen-antibody complexes link to FcR on the surface of macrophage. We studied on new serological test to detect antigen or antibody using linkage SRBC to FcR on the surface of refrigeration-fusion mouse macrophage. The SRBC for FcR linkage can detect all kinds of antigen or antibody specially. And it has high reappearance and accuracy. can be used in practice possibly. Because it doesn’t need special equipments and instruments in test and it is rapid, this test Conclusion  1) The optimal condition for linkage SRBC to FcR is as follows. Content of SRBC is 10%, protein concentration of refrigeration-fusion of mouse macrophage is 0.04%, linkage pH is 8.0～8.5, linkage temperature and time are 2h at 18～22℃, 1h at 28～30℃ or 37～38℃ respectively. 2) IFLHA is very specific and sensitive.
