Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 1 Juche103(2014) Isolation of Polysaccharide from Rootstalks of Polygonatum odoratum and Its Characteristics Kang Kyong Hwa, Han Chung Hwan and Kim Kwang Chol Abstract After rootstalks of Polygonatum odoratum was washed with water three times, with distillated water three times, and then extracted with distillated water at the temperature of 100℃ for 30 minutes three times, the optimal conditions for the isolation of insoluble high molecular polysaccharide from the sediments was established. First of all, the influences of the temperature, volume of solvent, period that affect extraction of high molecular polysaccharide were clarified by considering the yield of polysaccharide and the effect on the number of acidocyte and blood sugar. When the sample was extracted with water (the ratio between solid and liquid =1：8) at the temperature of 80℃ for 30 minutes, the yield of polysaccharide was the most and the number of acidocyte decreased significantly and blood sugar increased. The isolated polysaccharide formed white precipitate when alcohol was added and it became rosy yellow by reaction with phenol-sulphuric acid. When confirmed the constituent sugars of hydrolysate of the polysaccharide by PC, one spot appeared including arabinose, mannose, glucose and galactose. The constituent sugars and their composition ratio (arabinose, mannose, glucose and galactose are (0.92±0.01), (64.0±1.01), (7.3±0.2) and (0.82±0.03)%, respectively) are analyzed by infrared spectrum and GS-MS and the molecular weight was confirmed to be 100 000 ～ 150 000 by gelchromatography. Key words Polygonatum odoratum, polysaccharide, acidocyte, blood sugar  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “We must not hesitate to introduce in curative and preventive work new medicines and modern medical appliances which are based on the latest achievements of medical science and technology, and raise our methods of diagnosis and treatment to the world standard as soon as possible.”(“ON THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE HEALTH SERVICE” P. 13) Solomon’s seal is rootstalks of Polygonatum odoratum which belongs to Liliaceae. It includes steroidsaponin, flavonoid, phlegmatic temperament, mucopolysaccharide, neutralpolysaccharide, glucose, arabinose, mannitol and etc [5－7]. So far it has been known that there is odorantan, polysaccharide which is soluble in water in Polygonatum odoratum. Its molecular weight is about 5 000 and its constituent sugars are fructose, mannose, glucose, galactronic acid and etc [6]. Polygonatum odoratum is used in the treatment of diabetes, dipsia, myocardial insufficiency, hyperglycemia, etc. not only in our country but also in other countries[4, 7, 8]. According to the recent research high molecular polysaccharide in Polygonatum odoratum is － 97 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) effective in dermatopathy such psoriasis, eczema and etc [10]. While we were studying the pharmacological action of polysaccharide, we have discovered that the high molecular insoluble polysaccharide isolated from sediment of which odoratan is extracted decreases the number of acidocyte and increases blood sugar significantly and it is effective in dermatopathy such as psoriasis, eczema. Therefore we have studied on the isolation of polysaccharide from Polygonatum odoratum and clarification of its characteristics [1－3, 9, 10]. 1. Materials and Methods 1.1. Materials The rootstalk (loss on drying, 5%) of Polygonatum odoratum, glucose (A.P), arabinose (A.P), galactose (A.P) and mannose (A.P) were used in experiments. 1.2. Methods 1.2.1. The determination number of acidocyte and blood sugar 0.5mg/150g of polysaccharide isolated from Polygonatum odoratum was injected into tail vein of a mouse, 3 hours later, the number of acidocytes(dyeing with 1% water soluble eosin) and blood sugar (O-toluidine method) were determined and compared with the value before injection. 1.2.2. The determination of optimum extraction of high molecular polysaccharide from Polygonatum odoratum water three times. The dried rootstalks severed into 1～2cm were washed with water three times and with distilled After that they are extracted with water at 100℃, three times (each time for 30 minutes) and the sediments are crushed. The temperature and time of extraction, amounts of solvent (the ratio between solid and liquid) which affect extraction were examined by determining yield of polysaccharide and effects on the number of acidocyte and blood sugar. 1.2.3. The characteristics of high molecular polysaccharide isolated from Polygonatum odoratum The isolated polysaccharide is identified by using the reaction with alcohol and phenol-sulphuric acid and by PC.
