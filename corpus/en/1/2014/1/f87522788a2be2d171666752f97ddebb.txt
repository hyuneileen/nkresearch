Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 1 Juche103(2014) Electronic Transport through Quantum Dot Above and Below Kondo Temperature using Equation of Motion Method Ri Chol Won, Jong Kum Hyok and Ri Kuk Chol Abstract We study theoretically the Kondo effect in the quantum dot within the whole range of temperature including the Kondo temperature KT by using the equation of motion method based on the non-equilibrium Green function techniques. We have taken account of the finite Coulomb correlation and the non-equilibrium effect by calculating the correlation terms emerged from the decoupling approximation using the equation of motion method for the lesser Green function. Our results are the generalization into the pseudo-equilibrium state of the results of reference [5] and can be used to describe a non-equilibrium state under the bias voltage that is not so large. Key words non-equilibrium Green function, equation of motion method, Kondo temperature Introduction  The Kondo effect [1] in electronic transport through quantum dot (QD) strongly coupled to metallic leads was predicted theoretically and also observed experimentally. The Kondo effect is a typical instance to demonstrate an importance of the many-body effect in QD. One of the techniques used in the non-equilibrium situations is the non-equilibrium Green function (NGF) techniques [2]. To calculate density of state (DOS) and electric current one needs both retarded and lesser Green functions. The former one is usually calculated by the equation of motion (EOM) method in the framework of some decoupling approximation schemes. The most commonly used approximation [2] describes the situation rather well for temperatures close to the Kondo temperature KT as well as above KT . However, it is not correct for much smaller . In this regime, the approximation developed by ref. [3] is more appropriate.  temperatures T << KT The decoupling approximation [2] was applied to most of literatures [4－7] used EOM, and therefore very low temperature region T << could not be considered. KT On the other hand, the Kondo effect in the whole range of temperature including KT was studied [5] by using the approach developed [3], however, they [5] considered only the equilibrium state and calculated the correlation functions using fluctuation-dissipation theorem that is valid for the equilibrium state. In this paper, we investigate theoretically the Kondo effect in QD with finite Coulomb  correlation in the whole range of temperature including the Kondo temperature KT by using EOM method based on NGF techniques. － 39 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) 1.
