Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 1 Juche103(2014) Determination of Crystal Lattice Structure and Cohesive Energy of 3d Transition Metal Carbides by First-Principles Calculation Cha Sang Jun, Yu Chol Jun Abstract We obtained the optimal atomic coordinates using the experimental lattice constants (a=0.452 6nm, b=0.508 9nm, c=0.674 3nm) of cementite Fe3C. We calculated and analyzed the electron density distribution to make analysis about the nature of chemical bonds in the cementite structure. After determination of lattice constant parameters, we obtained the cohesive energy by subtracting the total energy of the crystal from the summation of total energies of atoms composing the crystal and dividing it by the number of atoms. Next, we inserted metal atoms into graphite structure, calculated the total energy and estimated the subtraction between the total energies of isolated metal atom and graphite crystal. Key words diamond, M3C, cohesive energy   Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “We should further strengthen scientific research and rapidly develop science and technology so that any scientific and technical problems in economic construction can be solved as soon as they arise and thus successfully make the national economy scientific and fully ensure that it becomes Juche-orientated and modern.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 35 P. 312) Now the catalytic transition metal elements Fe, Ni, Co, Mn and Cr are used in diamond synthesis most widely. Catalysis metal element Fe, Ni, Co, Mn form metastable carbides with a structure similar to that of Fe3C where each carbon is surrounded by six iron atoms in the process of diamond synthesis[2]. In the paper[4, 5] it proposed a combinative mechanism of HP-HT catalytic synthesis of diamond based on X-ray data obtained from synchrotron radiation and other experimental results. In this mechanism, they suggested that metal atoms of the `catalyst-solvent` diffuse between the graphite layers to form weakly bonded graphite intercalation compounds(GICs). We considered the typical transition metal carbides of cementite structure (M3C: M for metal, space group of Pnma) to investigate the interaction characteristics between transition metal elements and carbon atom. Based on the pseudopotential plane wave (PP-PW) method and the projector augmented wave (PAW) method within density functional theory (DFT), we have performed the first-principles simulations for determining the optimal crystal lattice constants of carbides containing the transition metal elements, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni, and first-row element C, compared with experimental ones, and calculated the binding energy (or cohesive energy)[1, 3]. － 44 － Determination of Crystal Lattice Structure and Cohesive Energy of 3d Transition Metal … 1．Simulation of Crystal Lattice Structure First of all, we obtained the optimal atomic coordinates using the experimental lattice constants (a=0.452 6nm, b=0.508 9nm, c=0.674 3nm) of cementite Fe3C.

The atomic coordinate parameters obtained in the simulations are (0.877, 0.440, 0.038, 0.837, 0.176, 0.068 and 0.332) in Fe3C, which are well agreed with the experimental ones (0.890, 0.450, 0.036, 0.850, 0.186, 0.063 and 0.328). These values in other carbides Mn3C, Co3C, Ni3C are also well agreed with the experimental ones within the negligible error of 10-2 magnitude. Next we performed the crystal lattice optimization. The obtained lattice constants are a=0.451 6nm, b=0.506 3nm, c=0.674 1nm in Fe3C, which are very close to the experimental ones. The situations are similar in other carbides. of chemical bonds in the cementite structure (Fig. 2). － 45 － We calculated and analyzed the electron density distribution to make analysis about the nature Fig. 1. Unit cell of cementite structure Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) As shown in the Fig. 2, the electron density is distributed intensively with almost spherical symmetric shape around Fe atom, while small amount of electron density is visible around C atom. Such thing tells us that the electrons transferred from C to Fe atom, Fe atoms are bonded with strong metallic bond and weak ionic bonding between Fe and C atoms exists. The carbon atoms, therefore, can be Fig. 2.

Since the structure factor is 4 in the cementite structure, the cohesive energy is as follows.

Cohesive energies of carbides Cohesive energy/(eV·atom-1) considered M3C-type carbides are 0.204 and 0.206nm. Carbides Next, we inserted metal atoms into graphite (Fig. 3), calculated the total energy and estimated the subtraction between the total energies of isolated metal atom and graphite crystal. In table 3 the total energies and the subtractions are shown. The total energy of the pure graphite crystal is 22.794 31Ha.

We can fabricate better diamond if the catalysis for synthesizing diamond could be developed considering such behaviors. References  [1] R. M.
