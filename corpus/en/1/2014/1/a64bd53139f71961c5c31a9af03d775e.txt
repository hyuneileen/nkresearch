The chain conformation in nitrocellulose-butyl acetate system was more straightened as nitrogen content decreased, and in the nitrocellulose-butyl acetate-n-butanol system with 12% of nitrogen content, the entropy component χs of thermodynamic interaction parameter χ was 0.310 and enthalpy component decreased with increase of temperature.  Key words nitrocellulose solution, thermodynamic characteristic, volume expansion coefficient, second viral coefficient  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows.  “They should intensify their scientific research for the scientific and technical solutions to the problems arising in making the national economy scientifically-based, and thus put the production and management activities of all branches on a new scientific base.” (“KIM JONG IL SELECTED WORKS” Vol. 10 P. 195) Nitrocellulose solutions are widely used for various purposes such as protection film or extraction membrane materials of producing electron element [11－14]. In order to prepare various functional membranes by using nitrocellulose solution, the thermodynamic interaction characteristics of nitrocellulose and several solvents must be ascertained. Now there were many researches on the solubility of nitrocellulose solution [5, 16, 18] but the results of researching the thermodynamic characteristics of nitrocellulose solution with the different content of nitrogen was not appeared. In this paper, the thermodynamic interaction characteristics of nitrocellulose (NC) with various content of nitrogen and butyl acetate and effects of nonsolvent on that were ascertained. Experimental Method  Different nitrogen-containing nitrocellulose was solved in butyl acetate individually and its concentrations were determined by evaporation to dryness method, its intrinsic viscocities were determined by using Ubbelohde viscometer. θ-state was made by turbidimetry with adding of the n-butanol(99.9%) in butylacetate solution of nitrocellulose and its intrinsic viscosity was determined. － 68 － Effects of Nonsolvent on the Thermodynamic Interaction of Nitrocellulose and Butyl Acetate And then volume expansion coefficient α and second virial coefficient A2, interaction parameter of polymer and solvent χ were estimated.

It was due to the decreasing of content of –OH group so that the interaction effects of nonsolvent in the nitrocellulose increase as nitrogen content increases. Because expressing the chain size in the disentanglement θη][ state was depending to M , the tendency according to the nitrogen content was not appeared. In case of adding the n-butanol in nitrocellulose-butyl acetate solution, the change of intrinsic viscosity [η] with content of adding n-butanol was shown as Fig. 1. － 69 － Fig. 1. The change of [η] according to the  content of n-butanol in the different  nitrogen-containing nitrocellulose 1－3 are nitrogen content of 11.4, 12.0 and 12.5% Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) As shown in Fig. 1, intrinsic viscosity decreased rapidly as content of n-butanol increased to V=50% and at more than that of the content of n-butanol, intrinsic viscosity increased a little. The change of volume expansion coefficient calculating by formula (1) was shown as table 2. α is the value to express the degree of straightening the macro chains in solution. The conformation of chains in solution straightened as the thermodynamic interaction between polymer and solvent was strong. The facts in table 2 was shown that n-butanol itself was a bad solvent for nitrocellulose but effect of one on chain conformation is good at the comfortable solvent mixture. The smaller the nitrogen content of nitrocellulose was, the better chain swelled. The changes of thermodynamic interaction parameter between nitrocellulose, butyl acetate and solvent mixture χ and second virial coefficient A2 were shown as table 3. Table 2.

That is, affinity between the nitrocellulose with big substitution degree and butyl acetate was bad. When the content of nitrogen in the most of solvent component was 12%, A2 was big. A2 is the value of deviate degree from ideal behavior and at the 12% of nitrogen content conformation state has differed most far from unperturbed state. But χ value in the nitrocellulose-butyl acetate-n-butanol system decreased as nitrogen content increased. It was shown that the more nitrogen content was, the better the effect of n-butanol in solution on the thermodynamic interaction between the macro chain and solvent was. At the 12.0% of nitrogen content and 25% of VB, χ value according to the temperature was estimated and entropy component χs of χ was etimated as 0.310 by χ－1/T relationship(Fig. 2).  The change of thermal function component χh according to temperature was as table 4. Table 4.

The effect of n-butanol on the interaction between nitrocellulose and butyl acetate was negative and became less with increase of nitrogen content. In nitrocellulose-butyl acetate-n-butanol system with 12% of nitrogen content, the entropy component χs of thermodynamic interaction parameter χ was 0.310 and enthalpy component decreased with increase of temperature.
