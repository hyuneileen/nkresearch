Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 1 Juche103(2014) Problem of Minimal Volume Design of Truss Structures Considering Strength Constraints and  Local Buckling Constraints Ri Chol Su Abstract We considered the problem of minimal volume design of truss structures with consideration of strength constraints for tensile members and local buckling constraints for compressive members. We derived an equalization criterion of energy density and optimization, proposed an algorithm for designing truss structures with minimal volume under different constraints for tension and compression, and verified validity of proposed method by using an example of the truss structure with 25 members. Key words equalization criterion, energy density, local buckling constraint, minimum volume design  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Research in the basic sciences should be intensified. Now that science and technology are advancing at a rapid pace and the role of modern technical devices is increasing rapidly in production and construction, there is an urgent need for the basic sciences to be developed still further.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 35 P. 312) Many studies on the problem for optimal design of several structures, particularly to determine optimal cross-sections of members of truss have done using equalization criterions of energy density.  The equalization criterion of energy density and its algorithm of the problem for optimal design of the structure with maximum stiffness and eigen frequency considering strength and stiffness of truss structure was proposed in [1－3], the equalization criterion of energy density of the problem for determination of reasonable reinforcement length of steel column giving the specified critical load was considered in [4] , and besides the equalization criterions of energy density and algorithms for optimal solution of the problem for optimal design of several structures with different objective functions and constraints were studied in large number. Methods of optimal design considering strength constraints by using difference-quotient algorithm, genetic algorithm and evolution structure optimization algorithm were also considered in [5－10]. But the symmetric constraints for both tension and compression were being considered in the problem of minimal volume design of truss structures in preceding works. Optimal solution algorithm considering both strength constraints for tensile members and local buckling constraints for compressive members is not studied yet. In this paper we considered the problem of minimal volume design of truss structures with consideration of both strength constraints for tensile members and local buckling constraints for compressive members by using equalization criterions of energy density. － 3 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) 1. Establishment of Problem It is known in the process for finding optimization criteria of differential structures that the structure with minimal volume in case global stiffness of structure is given becomes such a structure in which its strain energy density in everywhere is equalized to average strain energy density of the whole structure. This can be obvious in view of mechanical state of the structure. Although equalization of energy density grades up with equalization of stress distribution of structure, in general structures it is difficult to have strength limit directly corresponding to energy density because it is represented by shape strain energy. Particularly in the past it was difficult to consider strength condition in optimal design using the equalization criterion of energy density because stress limit of compressive member is related to Euler’s stress in truss structure. We can replace strength constraints for tensile members and local buckling constraints for compressive members in truss structure with energy constraints in following way. i I I [ 01 ∈ i (] t(  ) 1 , I Strength condition of truss structure can be represented as follows:  ension), (compressi [ σσ ≤ σσ ≥ is sets of numbers subjected to tension and compression respectively, where limit stress of member subjected to tension and equals to the yielding stress of material, [ 01σ is the [ 02σ  ] is the limit stress of member subjected to compression and equals to the critical stress of Euler in case of considering buckling.

(2) /( = 02 i c ) ] i i 2 2 Then, representing strain energy of i th truss member by stress U /2 =σ i i VE ⋅ i 2/ . Therefore total sum of strain energies for members under tension is as follows. U i = ∑ Ii ∈ 1 1 2 T u ⋅ ∑ Ii ∈ 1 uK i = 1 2 E ⋅ ∑ Ii ∈ 1 2 V σ i i Considering the strength condition for members under tension, strength constraint can be represented using limit value of energy as follows. uK i ≤ U 01 , i ∈            (3) 1I where U = 01 U i 01 = V i and stiffness matrix of member iK is the augmented stiffness ∑ Ii ∈ 1 2 ] 1 2 ∑ Ii ∈ 1 [ σ 01 E matrix of member element which has the same size as that of total structure. Similarly, for compressive member we can write as follows. uK i ≤ U 02 , i ∈            (4) 2I T u 1 2 ⋅ ∑ Ii ∈ 1 T u 1 2 ⋅ ∑ Ii ∈ 2 － 4 － Problem of Minimal Volume Design of Truss Structures Considering Strength Constraints … where U = 02 V i = 2 σ c i E 2 ∑ Ii ∈ 2 1 2 2 i 4 π JE 3 lF i i ∑ Ii ∈ 2 = 1 2 ∑ Ii ∈ 2 4 π E 4 ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ r i l i ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ minimal inertia radius of cross-section( r i = / FJ i i ).

This shows that it is important to account for buckling constraint for compressive members of the truss structures in practice. References  [1] 종합대학학보(자연과학), 10, 26, 1988.
