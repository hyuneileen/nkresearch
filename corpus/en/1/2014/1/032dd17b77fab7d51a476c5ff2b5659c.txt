The promising application fields of EHC include hybrid electric vehicles, uninterruptible power supplies and other electronic devices[8]. Electrode materials for EHC can be divided into three main categories; activated carbon, metal oxides and conducting polymers[2]. In recent years, manganese dioxide has been considered as an active electrode material of EHC, due to its low cost, excellent electrochemical performance and environmental friendly nature. In addition, several methods have been developed for preparing manganese dioxide, such as sol-gel method[9, 10], chemical precipitation[11], electrochemical deposition[3, 4], chemical redox deposition[12], solid–state reaction[1, 13] and physical vapor deposition[5]. Recently, a simple, novel and promising process for preparing the nano-sized oxide by solid-state reaction at low temperature has been demonstrated[6, 7]. In this paper, we have prepared the nano-MnO2 by solid–state reaction, manufactured the MnO2 electrode for EHC, and measured the capacitive characteristics of the MnO2 electrode using three electrolytic cell system. 1. Experimental Method 1.1. Preparation of MnO2 nanoparticles The nano-manganese dioxide was synthesized from KMnO4(chemical), MnSO4·H2O(analytical) and NaOH(chemical) by solid–state reaction, and polyethylenglycol(PEG) was used as the dispersion agent.  Every reagent was powdered smaller than 40μm on the agate mortar, and then they were mixed. － 72 － Performance of MnO2 Nano-Particles for Electrochemical Hybrid Capacitor Electrode Material Then, the mixture was heated in a water bath at 60℃ for 2.5h to make the reaction proceed completely: then, it was washed several times with deionized water, and washed twice with ethanol, and then filtered. The final product was dried at 100℃ to obtain the dark–brown powder. 1.2. Characterization of structure and morphology The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the product was recorded using a “XL–30” with CuKα radiation (λ=0.154 056nm) operated at 10～30kV and 40mA. The morphology and particle size of the product were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, “RINT2000”). 1.3. Electrode preparation and electrochemical characterization The nano-MnO2, acetylene black(AB) and polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE) binder were mixed completely in the weight ratio of 75：15：10, and pressed with a hand oil press under 30MPa onto a nickel-foam current collector, followed by drying at 80℃ for 12h. The specific capacitance of the MnO2 electrode was measured with three-electrolytic cell system, the active carbon electrode as a counter electrode, and Hg/HgO electrode as a reference electrode in 7mol/L KOH aqueous electrolyte. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Structure and morphology of MnO2 It is generally accepted that the necessary condition for the occurrence of solid state reaction at room temperature is that one of the reactances should have crystalline water or low melting point, on the one hand, sufficient grinding is also required to provide the reactant molecules with more contact opportunities[14]. The solid-state reaction between KMnO4 and MnSO4·H2O with NaOH proceeds as follows. 2KMnO4+3MnSO4·H2O+4NaOH = 5MnO2+2K2SO4+2Na2SO4+6H2O When solid KMnO4 was mixed with MnSO4·H2O and NaOH at room temperature, during the grinding process, the color of the mixture gradually darkened, and this indicated that the chemical reaction occurred successfully. The XRD pattern of the product is shown in Fig. 1, the main diffraction peak appeared at 2θ 37.46︒ corresponding to α–MnO2, while other peaks were broadened and lowered. Structural investigation indicated that the product has amorphous structure. The morphology of the product was examined by SEM. Typical image of the product is shown in Fig. 2, the particles were dispersed well, although some agglomeration is found. We could observe Fig. 1. XRD pattern of the nano-MnO2 Fig. 2.

This was much higher than that of 184F/g which was the reference[11]. introduced in discharge current density. where I is the discharge current, Δ V is the voltage change, Δ t is the discharge time, and m is the mass of MnO2 deposited on the working electrode. In addition, the specific capacitance of the MnO2 electrode was decreased with increasing the Therefore, we can conclude that the nano-MnO2 is a promising electrode material for EHC.  Conclusion  MnO2 nano-particles as the electrode material for EHC was sucessfully prepared by solid-state  reaction of KMnO4 with MnSO4·H2O.
