Oxidizing roasting of the ore at 600℃ makes the physicochemical and leaching characteristics was improved.  Key words uranium ore, roast, leaching  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “To put the national economy on a Juche basis we should first find more satisfactory solutions to the raw materials, fuel and power problems with our domestic resources. Exploiting our rich mineral resources to the full is an important way of solving these problems.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 35 P. 309) Uranium leaching process from a uranium ore is a typical example of reactions between solid and liquid, and its leaching rate depends on the physicochemical characteristics on surface of the ore [3, 4]. Especially, with oxidizing roasting the carbonaceous uranium ore done, the hydrophobic surface of the ore is changed to the hydrophilic one. When leaching uranium out of the roasted ore, penetration rate of the leaching solution into the ore is high, then it is available to have uranium leaching ratio high and to have leaching time short. Otherwise, when leaching uranium out of the raw ore by the sulphuric acid, the gases such as CO2 and H2S discharge and float up to the top of the solution with the carbonaceous substance and the humus, but, there are no such behavior in the leaching of the roasted ore and there are advantage in separating the solid and the liquid. The data on oxidizing roast of the carbonaceous uranium ore from the mine in our country have not been published yet. Experiment Method The oxidizing roasting the ore was carried out in the seramic crucible in the quartz tube with a heater through which air was ventilated with flux of 30L/(h·g) at the various temperature (400 ～800℃) every 2 hours by using the ore with granulation size in the range of 0.65～0.80mm. The pore distribution and the specific surface area of the ores were measured by the measure equipment on pore using the mercury compression method. － 58 － Change of some Physicochemical Characteristics in the Carbonaceous Uranium ore using… Hardness was measured by using the hardness microscaler “ТПП-2” about a unit cube of the ore abraded smoothly before and after roasting of it at 600℃, respectively. × 1cm) 1cm × (1cm We laid a weight with 5kg up on the hardness microscaler and made a trace by the diamond weight. And then we measured the length of diagonal in the trace by the microscope and calculated the absolute hardness by the following equation. P 2d where α－ angle of the diamond weight (°), P－ mass of the weight (kg) and d－diagonal length (mm). On measuring density of the ore were used the raw ore with granulation size less than 0.1mm, the substance floated after leaching by 0.5mol/L H2SO4 and washing under the condition of S:L=1:1.5, 1:6, respectively, and the fraction of the ore with granulation size less than 0.1mm roasted at 600 and 800℃.

First, we weighed a density bottle, filled it with a solvent to the scale (in case of the raw and roasted ore-deionizated water, in case of floated substance-dioxane) and weighed again. Second, we weighed the ore, poured it into the density bottle, filled with the solvent up to the scale of the bottle and weighed. Density was calculated with these values and density ρ of the solvents by the following equation. D OH 2 = Aρ OH 2 CA) − (B + D, dioxane = ρA ⋅ (B + dioxane CA) − (2) where A‐the weight of the ore, B‐the weight when feeling the solvent up to the scale and C ‐the weight when the ore was poured into the density bottle and the solvent was filled up to the scale of it. Physicochemical characteristics on surface of the ore were investigated by measuring the electric kinetic potential (ζ -potential) and the electric osmosis velocity ( Q ) in the raw ore and the roasted ore, respectively. Absorption speed and saturation amount of the water in the raw ore and the roasted ore were measured, respectively, and the method follows. We poured the raw ore or the roasted ore of 5.00g (granulation size less than 0.1mm, the roasting of the raw ore of 5.00g for 2 hours at 600℃), made it hard and contacted it with the capillary (diameter‐1.8mm) filled with the water. Movement velocity of the surface of the water was measured, and then saturation amount of the water was determined. Leaching of uranium from the raw ore and the roasted ore was carried out with and without the oxidation reagent, respectively, uranium concentration was determined by the spectrophotometry with arsenazo-Ⅲ from the leaching solution of 1mL and leaching ratio of uranium was calculated by it. Discussion ① Pore volume and specific surface area of the ores with the roast temperature Pore volume and specific surface area of the ores roasted at temperature in the range between 400 and 800℃ are shown in table 1. As shown in table 1, specific surface area of the ore roasted at 400℃ is the most great, but, it comes down with the roast temperature, and comes up a little at 800℃ because moisture and volatile component adsorbed into the ore were escaped without any chemical reaction [1, 2]. － 59 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche103(2014) Table 1.

At temperature over 400℃ the combustion of the carbonaceous material and the decomposition of the sulfide and the carbonate occur, it results in decreasing of micropore’s ratio and increasing of macropore’s ratio, therefore, whole pore volume increases while specific surface area decreases. But, at 800℃, the oxides in the ore form the double oxide and some sintering reactions occur, so micropores are formed while specific surface area increases a little again. ② Hardness and density of the roasted ores Generally, hardness of an ore is important factor on which power consumption in crushing and grinding process depends, power consumption increases with hardness of ore. Density of ore is also important thing in a process operation. Especially, precipitating rate increases and operating time decreases with density. Diagonal length of the traces measured by using the hardness micrometer was presented in table 2. Table 2. Diagonal length of the traces Sort of the ores Raw ore/mm Ore roasted at (600℃)/mm 1 0.413 1.32 2 0.427 1.38 3 0.440 1.38 4 0.387 1.14 5 － 1.14 Average 0.417 1.27 With calculated from equation (1) with data of table 2, absolute hardness in the raw ore is 53.3kg/mm2, and the one in the ore roasted at 600℃ is 5.71kg/mm2. That is, when roasting at 600℃, its hardness is almost 10 times smaller than that of the raw ore, so that grinding becomes easier. In table 3 are shown density values in the samples calculated from equation (2). Table 3. Density values in the raw and the roasted ores cm/g( 3  ) Sort of the ores The raw ore The floated substance The ore roasted at 600℃ The ore roasted at 800℃ 1 2.290 2.010 2.654 2.687 2 2.253 2.008 2.703 2.705 3 2.260 2.010 2.651 2.690 Average 2.268 2.009 2.670 2.696 As shown in table 3, roasting the raw ore makes its density increased almost 1.18 times because the carbonaceous and the humic substance with low density are eliminated from the ore [5－7]. And density of the floated substance is 2 times higher than that of the water, however, it is floated because it contains the hydrophobic substance a lot and, therefore, such gas drops as CO2 and H2S being generated in the leaching process using the diluted sulphuric acid stick on the hydrophobic  surface[8－15]. － 60 － Change of some Physicochemical Characteristics in the Carbonaceous Uranium ore using… This result shows that the time for separation between solid and liquid is reduced because of rapid sedimentation of the roasted ore and, otherwise, the process management is favorable because of absence of the floated substance. ③ Electro-chemical characteristics on surface of the ore Electric osmosis velocity ( Q ζ -potential 1 1 − ⋅ )Asm( ) and ) − 3 ⋅ (mV taking account of electric conductivity on surface can be expressed as the following equations. ζ = . . Q χη surface 10 ⋅ εε 0 ⋅ 3 k π ⋅= 2 Lr =⋅ 37.1 8 − m10 ⋅ 3 , Q = k It ⋅ , (3) where η ‐viscosity of water at 15℃, ε ‐relative dielectric constant at 15℃, 0ε ‐absolute ‐specific electric conductivity on surface of the ore , I ‐ dielectric constant of vacuum, surfaceχ current intensity, k ‐liquid volume in the measuring length unit (cm) and t ‐time. Influence of the roasting temperature on Q and ζ -potential was shown in Fig. 1 and 2. As seen in Fig. 1, Q are 1.32 410 − ⋅ and 109 ⋅ 5− s/mL 600℃, respectively, so those are much grater than ability of the ore was enhanced by elimination of the carbonaceous substance and etc. s/mL 8.98 10 ⋅ As shown in Fig. 2, ζ -potential tends to Q for its change. in the ores roasted at 500℃ and at 6− in the raw ore, because wet Oxidation reaction of carbon starts to take place at 450℃.

By strong electric attraction of such cations is compressed the diffusion layer of the electric double layer formed on surface of the ore which lies in a thermodynamic equilibrium state with the leaching dispersion, it results in decreasing of ζ -potential. Otherwise, at temperature over 800℃, double oxides, FeO Fe2O3, Fe2O3 MgO and etc., are formed, and, especially, at 900℃, even partial sintering in the ore occurs, so ζ -potential becomes to be small. ④ Absorption characteristics of water in the ores Effect of the temperature on water absorption velocity and water saturation amount in the Fig. 2. Influence of roasting temperature on ζ -potential carbonaceous uranium ore was shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, water absorption velocity and water saturation amount increase almost lineally according to roasting temperature in the range of 300～700℃. In the ore roasted at 600℃, these are 1.5 times more than those in the raw ore, because the hydrophobic components have been got rid from surface of the ore and pore ratio of the ore has increased as a result of the roasting (table 1). Therefore, oxidizing roasting makes surface of the ore turned into the one favorable to chemical reaction between solid and liquid. Fig. 3. Effect of roasting temperature on water absorption velocity(V) and water saturation amount (S) ⑤ Uranium leaching from the roasted ore We carried out leaching experiment under the condition of particle size of －0.1mm, 0.5mol/L sulphuric acid, S:L of 1:1.5, temperature of 60℃ and leaching time of 6h for the roasted ore and the raw ore, respectively. At that time, was also considered the case that MnO2 was added by 0.4% to the ore as an oxidant in order to check out the effect of oxidizing roasting. The result is presented in table 4. As shown in table 4, leaching ratio of uranium increased with the roasting temperature whether there was the oxidant or not, and it decreased at temperature over 600℃. Table 4. Leaching ratio of uranium with the roasting temperature Oxidant Absence Existence Enhanced Leaching ratio Roasting temperature/℃ 700 600 91.4 93.5 96.3 98.0 4.9 4.5 500 90.8 95.0 4.2 Ore 88.0 91.4 3.4 800 88.0 89.6 1.6 － 62 － Change of some Physicochemical Characteristics in the Carbonaceous Uranium ore using … The most high leaching ratio obtained in the ore roasted at 600℃ resulted from that the surface electric property has improved while, first of all, that temperature has being the most proper for oxidation of UO2 to UO3. In case of the ore roasted at 600℃ without the oxidant, its leaching ratio was more 2.1% high than that in case of the raw ore with the oxidant. Otherwise, leaching ratio decreased because of reduction of UO3 to UO2 at temperature over 600℃ and because of partial sintering of the ore at temperature around 800℃. Conclusion  With the carbonaceous ore roasted at 600℃, pore ratio of it increased more 1.84 times , specific surface area decreased less 1.42 times, its hardness decreased almost less 10 times and its density increased more 1.18 times than that of the raw ore. Otherwise, electric osmosis velocity in the ore roasted at 600℃ was higher 7.8 times than that in the raw ore, and water saturation amount and absorption velocity of water in the ore roasted at 600℃ were approximately more 1.5 times than that in the raw ore, respectivly. In case of the ore roasted at 600℃, leaching ratio was enhanced more 2.1% without the oxidant than that in case of the raw ore with the oxidant.
