Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 4 Juche103(2014) The Effect of Corn Pollen on Some Antioxidant Indices and Biochemical Indices of Muscle after Exertion of Rat Kim Chang Won, Yun Yong Hak, Pak Yong Gum and Jo Song Chol Abstract In order to find out the effect of corn pollen on the antioxidant system we made exertion models in rat an examined the actions of corn pollen. We destroyed the pollen membrane mechanically and administered 3.0g/kg daily for 15 days orally, make it swim so that we could make exertion models. After that, we examined antioxidant indices. As a result, corn pollen significantly increased the decreased thigh muscle catalase and SOD activity and decreased the thigh muscle, serum and urinal MDA levels significantly. Key words corn pollen, anti-oxidation  Introduction  Recently, the study on the pollens such as the pine tree pollen, pollens on bees, rape pollen and so on is intensified to use in prevention and therapy of diseases, but there are few data about corn pollen usage. Pollen contains lots of nutritional and bioactive materials among natural products. Pollen is the only complete nutritional natural food that has protein, oil, sugar, vitamins, minerals, hormones, enzymes, and etc [4, 10]. The nutritious value of pollen equals with those of 48% bean flour mixed with 16% of dried protein enzyme, 16% of dried milk, 10% of casein, and 10% of yolk [6, 8]. The proteins in the pollen are globulin, albumin, protamin, glutein and simple protein, glucoprotein, nucleoprotein, lipoprotein. The characteristic of pollen protein is that the half of pollen consists of 2 to 5 amino acids. Free amino acids is 4～7% and higher than the other plants. Among 22 amino acids distributed in the nature now, 20 amino acids were discovered in the pollen [2, 6, 7]. The level of essential amino acids among them in pollen are 5～7 times as much as beef or egg and 3～10 times than honey which is very well-known as the best healthy food [3, 5]. Pollen contains 13～30% of protein, 1～17% of lipid, 12～39% of carbohydrate and 0.6wt% of vitamin B1, 1.7wt% of B2 29.0wt% of nicotine acid, 70～150wt% of vitamin C and in addition,  serin, sistin, especially iron, calcium and magnesium are included properly. Besides, it contains 90 kinds of enzymes such as nucleic acid, catalase, amylase, protease and sexual hormones, growth stimulator, antibiotics, etc which are necessary to the body [1, 9, 10]. Pollen contains antivirus or antibiotic materials that kill Bacillus typhi or Escherichia coli [6]. Now in order to harvest more corn profit as required by the Juche-oriented farming method, － 72 － The Effect of Corn Pollen on Some Antioxidant Indices and Biochemical Indices … 3/4 of the corn tassel is cut off. If we use the thrown-away tassels uselessly in the past to contribute to the people’s well-being, it is not only very significant economically, but also very beneficial to the public health reality, however, there are few data about research on the corn pollen. Therefore, we tried to find out the effect of corn pollen on the anti-oxidation system of the body.  1. Objectives and Methods 1.1. Material We gathered con pollen in Unjon County, North Phyongan Province during the period of July to August and destroyed the pollen membrane for 2 days mechanically using a pollen micro pulverizer. The pollen with 95% of corn membrane destruction is examined through microscope and used in this experiment. Control group uses the distilled water. We use the rats weighing at 150～180g that were bred in the animal department of Pyongyang Medical College of Kim Il Sung University without distinction of gender. 1.2. Method In experimental group, the corn pollen is orally administered with 3.0g/kg daily for 15 days to the rats. Then we made it swim in the 20-liter of water tank for 20 minutes to make the exertion model and examined the antioxidant indices. 1.2.1. CAT activity examination Oxidation-reduction titration by potassium permanganate is used to measure CAT activity. 1.2.2. SOD activity examination Nitrous acid method is used to measure SOD activity. 1.2.3. MDA level examination 2-thiobarbituric acid method is used to measure MDA level. 1.2.4. Muscle glycogen, glucose, protein level examination Anthrone method for muscle glycogen level, o-toluidine boric acid method for muscle glucose level and filter paper bromphenol blue method for muscle protein level are used respectively. 2. Result and Discussion 2.1. The effect of corn pollen on the rat’s thigh muscle CAT and SOD activity after exertion First, we examined the effect of corn pollen on the rat’s thigh muscle CAT and SOD activity after exertion (table 1). Table 1. The effect on the rat thigh muscle CAT and SOD activity As you can see in table 1, the CAT activity in the corn pollen group which had exertion before being fed with corn pollen was 0.87±0.04 U·g-1, and that of the control group which only had an exertion was (0.40±0.03)U/g, so the corn pollen group has the significant-increased thigh muscle CAT activity CAT /(U·g-1) 0.90±0.01 0.4±0.03 0.87＊±0.04 * p<0.05(comparing with control group), n=7 SOD /(U·g-1) 1.37±0.14 0.56±0.13 1.35＊±0.16 Group Normal Control Corn pollen (p<0.05). － 73 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 4 Juche103(2014) The SOD activity in the corn pollen group which had exertion before being fed with corn pollen was (1.35±0.16)U/g, and that of the control group which only had an exertion was (0.56±0.13)U/g, so the corn pollen group has the significant increase thigh muscle SOD activity (p<0.05). 2.2. The effect of corn pollen on the rat’s thigh muscle MDA level, serum MDA level and urinal MDA level after exertion Next, we examined the effect of corn pollen on the rat thigh muscle MDA level, serum MDA level and urinal MDA level after exertion (table 2－4). As you can see in table 2, the thigh muscle MDA level after exertion with the administration of corn pollen was (640.8±40.3)nmol/g and that of the control group without administration was        (1 048.7±39.8)nmol/g, which shows significant decrease in the experimental group. Table 2.

Group Normal Control Corn pollen *p<0.05(comparing with control group) n = 7 MDA/(nmol·mL－1) 11.2±0.8 27.8±1.4 13.6＊±1.2 The urinal MDA level after exertion with the administration of corn pollen (13.6±1.2)nmol/mL, and that of the control group without administration was (27.8±1.4)nmol/mL, which shows significant-decreased MDA in the experimental group. 2.3. The effect of corn pollen on the muscle glycogen, glucose, and protein level after exertion Group Table 5: The effect of the corn pollen on the muscle glycogen, glucose and protein level after exertion The results of muscle glycogen, glucose and protein level of the rats which were fed with corn pollen for 15 days and forced to swim for 20 minutes are as follows (table 5). Glycogen/g% Glucose/g% Protein/(mg·g－1) 66.5±12.8 38.6△±7.8 64.5＊±6.3 28.2±2.4 19.3△±1.5 26.2＊±2.1 As you can see in table 5, the muscle △ p<0.05(comparing with Normal), * p<0.05(comparing with glycogen level in the experimental  control), n = 7 group which has exertion with corn pollen administration was (0.59±0.05)g%, in the control group without administration was (0.4±0.05)g%, which means significant increase in muscle glycogen level in the experimental group (p<0.05) and the glucose and protein levels are also significantly increased in the experimental group with the administration of the corn pollen (p<0.05). Normal Control Corn pollen 0.62±0.07 0.40△±0.05 0.59＊±0.05 － 74 － The Effect of Corn Pollen on Some Antioxidant Indices and Biochemical Indices … These above results show the positive effect of corn pollen on the altered antioxidation system of the body and its activity to increase the muscle glycogen, glucose and protein concentration significantly, and these actions are related to those of the various bioactive materials rich in corn pollen. Conclusion  Corn pollens give the positive impact on the muscle, serum and urinal antioxidation indices and increase the glycogen, glucose and protein concentration of muscle. References [1] B. D.
