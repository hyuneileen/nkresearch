Calculating Probability Maximum Wind Velocities in Region 1.1. Primary data Primary data are measured wind data during 40 years in research region from 1971 to 2010(height: 10m, 10min averaged data). We have proved that among some known theoretical distribution functions the distribution function which explains well the probability distribution is Kambel distribution function. The excess probability of Kambel distribution function is computed as ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪⎩ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ where x and xσ are averaged value and standard deviation of annual maximum wind velocities , according to sample number n, also y and yσ are calculated by following expression. σ y σ x y −− 1 −= ⎫ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪⎭ exp exp ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ P − − x x ) ( y = 1 n n ∑ i 1 = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ − l n − l n 1 − ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ 1 + n 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ When the excess probability is P, the maximum wind velocity ⎤ −⎥ ⎦ n ∑ 1 i = 1 + σ y ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ − − = − 1 1 n y l l 2 n n X p α ⋅= y p + ( α x ⋅− y ) − g pX is computed is as follows. where x σσσ y = / , y l l −−= n [ n p 1( − p )] is, n is sample number, i means the order of size of it.

The calculation results and analysis. We calculated the maximum probability wind velocities of 1, 2, 5, 10%, and 20% on three places in research region. The maximum probability wind velocities are indicated in table 2. As you can see in table 2, the maximum wind velocities of 1% probability on the region is 19m/s or so, and therefore, the wind velocity with the 100 year-excess rate surely would be under 20m/s. So using the wind velocity 20m/s of 1% probability for design of windbreaks as the design wind velocity can be secured in scientific way (These wind velocity values are 10 minute-averaged ones.).

Using “ Windbreaks Distribution εE − ” turbulence-closure model 2.1. “ It is well known that the turbulence-closure model is used in solving the fundamental equations of atmosphere phenomenon [1, 2]. As the one-dimension closure model (K-method) is simple one, it is widely applied, on the other side it has the defect that it can use only on the even topography and did not consider the effect of the topographical inequality and obstacle. The multiple-dimension closure model, its physical base nearly approached on the practice, but it has the defect which is difficult to use in the practice because the amount of calculation is enormous. Through a compromise between both sides, “ ε−E ” turbulence-closure model was appeared; it is a 1.5-dimension model. Using this model, the effect of the uneven surface of the earth horizontally and the course ” the kinetic energy of of advection can be correctly simulated. Also, in the model “ ε−E － 101 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 4 Juche103(2014) turbulent (E) and its dissipation velocity can be used in order to obtain the coefficient of turbulent exchange. Several kinds of the turbulence-closure model using in the practice were considered 2.1.1. The standard model “ The simplest model on turbulent consists of two transport equations to calculate the turbulent ”, and it is velocity and the length scale. The typical one of them is the standard model “ used in the wide field for its stability in calculating, economic effectiveness and correctness [4]. It is the semi-experienced model made of the transport equation about the kinetic energy of εE − ” ε−E turbulent (E and its dissipation velocity. ) The transport equation on E is given under the correct leading of equation and one on ε is calculated by using the experienced values and an mathematic analogue.

Estimation on the effect of the windbreak of the strips in special case Generally, the grassland is not a plane, but a complex form of the land, and the wind direction is always out of plumb with the direction of the windbreaks distribution. 3.2.1. In case an angle between the major wind direction and the strips is an acute one If you need to increase the windbreak effect of the windbreaks, you have to distribute it along a ridge. But when the distribution direction of a ridge is out of plumb with the major wind direction and have an acute angle to it, the windbreaks distributed along a ridge form an acute angle with the major wind direction. The effect on the windbreak of the windbreaks is varied by this angle, and thus we have to Table 3. Windbreak effects calculation according to the angle between the major wind direction and the strips decide the space between the strips correctly. No. When the strip width is 20m, the strips height is 12m, the draft level is 30%, wind velocity is 18m/s, the surface rough rate is 0.01m, the calculating results of windbreak effect according to the angle between the major wind direction and the strips are same as table 3. As you can see, in case of 90°, 80° and 70°, mean velocity of 200m to 300m, with the greatest velocity never exceeds 6th-grade. 2.4 2.3 2.0 1.6 0.8 3 7.1 7.2 7.8 8.6 10.0 11.8 90 80 70 60 50 45 Angle /(°) 1 2 3 4 5 6 Wind velocity at several at position/m.s-1 100m 200m 300m Mean wind velocity in several section/m.s-1 100～200 m 3.5 3.6 3.8 4.0 5.0 8.6 200～300 m 9.5 9.8 9.9 10.8 12.1 13.8 0～100 m 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.2 2.1 11.5 11.6 12.1 12.8 13.7 14.7 From this point of view, we recognize that the windbreak effect on the vertical angle merely changes even when the windbreaks forms 70° with the major wind direction. 3.2.2.

As you can see in table 4, while the volley deep is 10m, in the block of 300m to 500m the mean wind velocity is 12.5m/s, and thus we do not need to distribute the support windbreaks. 3.3.
