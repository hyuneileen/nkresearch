This reaction achieved under the normal temperature and pressure, oxygen removal capacity by the oxidation of manganese(II) oxide was closely related with the reduction process of manga- nese(II) oxide by hydrogen[1, 2, 5]. By the oxidation process of manganese(II) oxide under the normal temperature and its reduc- tion by hydrogen at 450℃, it is a question of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction by hydrogenation Kinetic study on the hydrogen-oxygen reaction over MnxOy-rare earth oxide-clay catalyst was Key words manganese, oxygen removal, kinetic study of oxygen. investigated. Introduction The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “Now is the age of science and technology, and unprecedently fast speed is the ma- jor characteristic of the development of modern science and technology.” (“KIM JONG IL SELECTED WORKS” Vol. 12 P. 199) To purify of various kinds of gas, such as hydrogen, nitrogen and argon, is a pressing problem in many domains of national economy including electric automation industry, produc- tion of pure metals and high purity material synthesis. To remove impurity oxygen is important before anything else in purifying of various kinds of gas. Because production of such raw gases is based on separating of corresponding elements in air and it is unavoidable saturation of air in its saving and handling. In the preceding study, there are two methods for oxygen removal － method using the oxidation of metal and metal oxide, and removal with the water by hydrogenation of oxygen using precious metal or transition metal catalyst. In general, it has been known to kinetically consider the hydrogen-oxygen reaction over the precious metal or transition metal catalyst[2－4, 6－10], but not almost using manganese － 45 － series as catalyst. Oxygen Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 4 Juche103(2014) In this paper, kinetic study on the hydrogen-oxygen reaction over the MnxOy-rare earth oxide-clay catalyst that has the most capacity for oxygen removal was investigated. 1. Kinetic Consideration by Variation of the Partial Pressure Ratio of Hydrogen and The hydrogen-oxygen reaction, that is our attention, is a comparatively simple reaction that the starting materials are oxygen and hydrogen, its rate question of reaction can be de- scribed as follows under the certain conditions.

Experimental Method Kinetic experiment was made with considering the variation rate of oxygen, according to analysis of oxygen concentration of input and output with gas-chromatography (“GC-4B”) after putting up 1mL of catalyst in the flow type fixed layer reactor. Reaction gas was diluted to corresponding partial pressure after adjusting the ratio of oxygen and hydrogen. － 46 － and oxygen(Fig. 1).

Kinetic Study on the Hydrogen-Oxygen Reaction over the Manganese Oxide Catalyst From the gradient of linear equation above, the apparent activation energy E≠ is 3. The Mechanism of the Hydrogen-Oxygen Reaction over the Manganese Ox- ide(MnxOy) Catalyst based on prior kinetic experiment. We have brought out the mechanism for the hydrogen-oxygen reaction over the catalyst By our study, the order related to the initial reactant can not be negative at any condi- tions in adsorption-collision mechanism, while it can be negative in adsorption-adsorption mechanism. Therefore it presumes that this kinetic experimental result can be performed as adsorption-adsorption mechanism. To confirm it, we made following experiment and then con- sidered its mechanism. Above all black catalyst was filled in reaction tower and passed nitrogen gas. With in- creasing of temperature from 250℃ to 450℃ as an interval of 100℃ and maintaining for one hour at each temperature, the color change was observed. It was observed that the color changed in dark brown after an hour at 250℃, in dark grey at 350℃ and in greenish gray at 450℃. Changing color of the catalyst from black to greenish gray in flowing of inert gas nitrogen suggest that the dissociation of oxygen arise as consequence of the process of Mn2O3→Mn3O4→MnO with increasing of temperature over the catalyst layer. And then by empirical data that we obtained, even though the catalyst was reduced for a long time at 250 ℃  in reducing process of catalyst by hydrogen, color of the catalyst only changed in gray. Through such experimental and empirical data, physical property for manganese oxide, we   and guess that the catalyst for the hydrogen-oxygen reaction is intermediate between Mn3O4 Mn2O3 and such state can be as a transient state composing from dissociation adsorption of oxygen to Mn3O4. We are going to express as MnxOy such state and consider the mechanism for such reaction with supposing it as an activation center of catalyst at the hydrogen-oxygen reaction. MnxOy. And then we have considered the adsorption characteristics of O2 and H2 to catalyst Hydrogen-oxygen reaction over the catalyst is an inhomogeneous catalyst reaction and it has precondition for adsorption of reactants oxygen and hydrogen onto catalyst surface. So adsorption amount data of reactant on the catalyst has a significant as basic data for solution of reaction mechanism. The experiment was performed with volume calculation method after reaching to adsorp- tion balance, with changing pressure of oxygen and hydrogen at normal temperature and － 49 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 4 Juche103(2014) 240℃ with high vacuum adsorption equipment. By the experiment at the normal temperature adsorption of oxygen and hydrogen observed hardly but it observed clearly around 200℃. Fig. 5 shows adsorption isotherm of O2 and H2 on the catalyst MnxOy at 240℃. Fig. 5. Adsorption curves of hydrogen and oxygen to the manganese oxide. 1－O2, 2－H2 The adsorption amount of O2 over the MnxOy at 240℃ was much above 10 times than thing of H2 that considered in general range of pressure. This is a reason for difference in the adsorption capacity between O2 and H2 over the MnxOy, and it shows that the capacity of oxygen is far large than that of hydrogen. For clear up the mechanism for the hydrogen-oxygen reaction over the catalyst MnxOy, it made assumption as following from based on such experimental fact. Firstly, reactants O2 and H2, it makes dissociation adsorption on the surface of MnxOy. Secondly, adsorption process of O2 and H2 onto the surface of MnxOy is fast and in bal- ance state actually. Thirdly, adsorption intensity of oxygen is much large than that of hydrogen and adsorp- tion center of the catalyst surface is saturated approximately by adsorption sorts of oxygen under the reaction condition. Based on such assumption, the mechanism of reaction producing water by hydrogenation of oxygen on the surface of catalyst MnxOy was considered with adsorption-collision mecha- nism and adsorption-adsorption mechanism. 4.

After all this suggest that the mechanism of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction by heterogene- ous reaction of hydrogen and oxygen on the surface of catalyst is not adsorption-collision mechanism.  5.

After all, we can see the hydrogen-oxygen reaction over the catalyst carry out according to adsorption-adsorption mechanism that surface hydroxyl group is formed from between atom- icity oxygen formed by dissociation adsorption of oxygen, hydrogen and hydrogen and then water is produced by reaction between this hydroxyl group and another atomicity hydrogen.
