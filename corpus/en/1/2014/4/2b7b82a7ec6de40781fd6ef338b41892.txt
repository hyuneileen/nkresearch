Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 4 Juche103(2014) Neutron Transport Calculation in Hexagonal Fuel Assembly by Transmission Probability Method Ho Il Mun, So Chol and Ryu Kum Bong Abstract We have made the numerical calculation model to solve the neutron integral trans- port equation in hexagonal fuel assembly by transmission probability method, and developed computational code TPHEX. The accuracy and efficiency of this numerical method were veri- fied from the comparison with the numerical result of MCNP5 for the standard problem. Key words hexagonal geometry, fuel assembly, transmission probability method  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Many power stations using atomic energy and other new sources of power should be built to increase power output radically.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 35 P. 317) Cores of most of fast breeding reactors and VVERs consist of hexagonal fuel assembly. Neutron transport calculation in hexagonal fuel assembly is investigated less than for the rec- tangular. Transmission probability method, one of integral transport methods, is widely applied in physics calculation on fuel assembly of nuclear reactor. The accuracy of calculation results is considerably related with approximation applied to spatial and angular distribution of neu- tron flux within and surfaces of homogenized cell. Preceding studies[1－4] assumed that the spatial distribution of neutron flux within cell is linear or quadratic, but at surfaces of cell is constant. And response matrix method was used to get expansion factors of spatial distribution equation, so consumed a considerable computa- tional time. In this paper the interior neutron flux and source within homogenized hexagonal cells which constitute fuel assembly are assumed as to be quadratic spatial distribution and isotropic angular distribution. At cell surfaces the simplified P1 approximation for anisotropic angular distribution and quadratic spatial distribution are considered. And by introducing co-ordinates of rotation transform, the expansion factors were repre- sented with the average neutron fluxes at the inside region and boundaries of cell, so that efficiency of calculation was enhanced. Based on this model, the computer code TPHEX which calculates spatial-energy distribution and homogeneous parameters of hexagonal fuel as- sembly is developed. － 40 － Neutron Transport Calculation in Hexagonal Fuel Assembly by Transmission Probability Method 1. Calculation Model Hexagonal fuel assembly is divided by homogenized hexagonal cells. Neutron multi-group integral transport equation in individual cell is as follows. φ g r ,( 0 l ) =Ω ∫ 0 rQ ( g Ω′ , ) exp ( Σ− l tg cos ) θ + φ g ( r s , Ω ) exp ( Σ− l 0 tg cos )θ (1) dl cos θ Surfaces of each hexagonal cell in assembly are assigned numbers as Fig. 1 a).

For interior neutron flux and source within homogenized hexagonal cell, their spa- tial and angular distributions in new coordi- nates are represented as follows. Fig. 1.

Let us integrate both sides of equation (2) over the inside region and surfaces of cell and rewrite. Then expansion factors are represented by the average values at the inside region and boundaries. In case of source, its expansion coefficients are written by ones of neutron flux as follows.

This method is much simpler and more efficient than the previous one using response matrix[1－4]. Neutron balance equation in cell is as follows.

Based on proposed model, we developed the computational code TPHEX which calculate neutron transport in hexagonal fuel assembly.   2.

(The calculations were performed by the computer with 3GHz of clock and 512MByte of DDRAM.) Conclusion  A method to solve neutron multigroup integral transport equation in hexagonal fuel as- sembly by transmission probability using spatial and angular distributions assumed respectively by quadratic and simplified P1 approximations has been developed. The numerical results of the Benchmark problem are compared with those of code MCNP5, and these are all in good agreement. References [1] Ser Gi Hong et al.; Ann. Nucl. Energy, 25, 8, 547, 1998.
