Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 4 Juche103(2014) On a New Moving Method of Cloud Reasoning Kwak Son Il，Kim Kum Ju Abstract We proposed the principle of cloud reasoning based on the new idea of generating the consequent cloud, reflecting the expected value, variance, hyper-variance and movement to the consequent membership cloud in the view that clouded membership cloud can be consid- ered as the movement of input membership cloud. The moving method of cloud reasoning by this principle satisfies the reductibility condition. Key words cloud reasoning, moving method Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “Scientists and technicians should work to overcome by their own efforts the prob- lems which require an urgent solution for the development of the national economy of our country, and to introduce the scientific and technical successes of developed countries in accordance with its specific reality.”(“KIM JONG IL SELECTED WORKS” Vol. 10 P. 195～ 196) In the previous researches, they proposed cloud reasoning method inducting the conclusion using input information and feedforward cloud generator, and proceeded cloud reasoning with- out the cloudization of input information. In the paper [2], there are some disadvantages that do not satisfy the reductibility because there is no cloudization of input information. The restoration is the property that consequent should be equal to the consequent of the cloud rule in the case that the fact information and the antecedent of the cloud rule when the cloud rule and the fact information are entered in the rulebase[1]. In the paper [3, 4], there is no process obtaining the variance and hyper- variance of the input cloud in generation of normal random number because of no cloudiza- tion of input. That is, it has some limitations in expressing the randomness of the antecedent of cloud rule and doesn’t reflect the fuzziness and probabilistic characteristics which is one of the advantages of cloud theory simultaneously. In this paper, we formulize the new idea of moving method of cloud reasoning based on moving method, and the basis of it we propose the cloud modus ponens from the new angle. Thus we overcome the disadvantage of the previous research[2－4]. 1. Moving Method of Cloud Reasoning We assume that there is some moving relation between the membership cloud of antece- dent membership cloud and new input information when giving if~then~type cloud reasoning rule and the input information. Then moving method of cloud reasoning is defined － 16 － On a New Moving Method of Cloud Reasoning as derivation of new consequent membership cloud by reflecting this relation in antecedent. The simplest if~then reasoning modus ponens can be expressed as follows. is where x is input variable, y output variable, A antecedent membership cloud, B consequent c onsequent B y antecedent antecedent 1  if x  2 x is A then y is B is ′ A ′ (1) cloud, 'A membership of input 'x and 'B consequent. The concrete procedure realizing the moving method of cloud reasoning is as follows.
