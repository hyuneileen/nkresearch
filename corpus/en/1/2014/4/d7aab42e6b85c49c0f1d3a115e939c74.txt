Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 4 Juche103(2014) The Fraunhofer Diffraction occurring in a Refractive Index Matched GRISM based on HDG Jo Chon Gyu, Choe Chol Gyu Abstract We have composed a new type of dispersive element consisting of a refractive in- dex modulation HDG and a prism, and have investigated the Fraunhofer diffraction character- istics of the GRISM disperse system. First, we have used a high-resolution holographic plate “Лои-2” as the board to form a holo- graphic amplitude grating, and then have processed it with Br2 to build a refractive index modulation HDG, finally investigating its diffraction efficiency characteristics. We have found a reasonable refractive index matching condition to attach the HDG and glass prism to each other, thus composing a new type of GRISM dispersive system and investigat- ing its Fraunhofer diffraction characteristics. Key word holographic refractive grating Introduction The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Today scientists and technicians are faced with a very important task. They must forge ahead more energetically with scientific research work in order to make a great contribution to raising the scientific and technological level of the country to a higher stage and developing the national economy at a rapid pace.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 37 P. 359) Using a GRISM which is composed of an HDG and a prism attached to each other under the condition of refractive index matching, we study the characteristics of the Fraunhofer diffrac- tion occurring in the GRISM. The GRISM is a new disperse element which is a combination of a diffraction grating and a prism. Research is mainly performed on improving the characteristics of the diffraction grating which gives the main effect of divergence [2－4]. But there were no former investigations on a GRISM designed in a phase matching method based on a refractive index modulation HDG. This paper presents the implementation of the refractive index matching of a phase HDG and a prism which has been produced from a high resolution holographic plate “Лои-2” by processing with Br2, thus gives solution to the stabilization problem of the grating and eluci- dates the Fraunhofer diffraction characteristics. － 26 － The Fraunhofer Diffraction occurring in a Refractive Index Matched GRISM based on HDG 1. Fraunhofer Diffraction in a Prism-Slit Disperse System First, we will discuss the phenomena occurring in an optical system consisting of a slit and a prism, instead of HDG. Consider an optical system like Fig. 1 where a slit of width 0a is attached to a wedge type crossed prism and let the incident light be a plane light wave. In this case the light wave entering this sys- tem is bound to undergo a continuous phase- change along the slit face. Let the center of slit 0 be the origin of co- ordinates and assume that the apical angle δ of Fig. 1. Fraunhofer diffraction in a prism-slit optical system the prism is not large. Now then, at coordinate y the prism's geometric thickness is δ δy+ a 0 2 and its optical thickness is δ nδy+ where n is the refractive index of the prism's material. ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ a 0 2 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ Thus, the according phase change is Δ α ⎛ kn= ⎜ ⎝ δ a 0 2 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ a 0 2 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ δak+δy+ − 0 δ δy+ (1) where =k . λπ/ 2 The first term of (1) is the phase change through the prism and the second term is the phase change caused by the optical path 0δa . Meanwhile, according to Huygens-Fresnel's principle the amplitude distribution of the dif- fraction pattern in the Fraunhofer area can be described as [1], ′Φ ( , x dxdy ′ =y ) ) ey ,( x + ′ yy xx ik ( ) ′ (2) thus assuming that the slit is infinitely long, we can consider the light area distribution Ψ as one-dimensional and describe it as Ψ )( =y αΔ ie .

Fraunhofer Diffraction in a Refractive Index Modulation HDG We have implemented refractive index modulation by treating an amplitude modulation HDG with Br2. The amplitude modulation HDG has been obtained from a high resolution holographic plate “Лои-2”. If the amplitude grating consisting of silver halide emulsion is processed with Br2, hard- ening of the emulsion by tanning[5] doesn’t occur. Only an oxidation reaction 2Ag+Br2  which has a refractive index greater than that of →2AgBr occurs which forms AgBr gelatin , thus implementing refractive index modulation. )52.1 )25.2 ( =n ( =n Investigation of the Fraunhofer diffraction characteristics by this 600mm－ 1 grating shows that Bragg effect is ostensible(Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows that in case of normal incident light the first order efficiency amounts to only a few percentages, while 78%, most of the incident flow of light concentrates on the primary maximum. In case of Bragg angle incident light most of the incident flow of light concentrates on the first order and only 13% is allocated to the primary maximum. This fact gives the result that the distribution of light intensity depends strongly on the incident angle and if the incident light enters at Bragg angle the first order diffraction efficiency gets to the maximum of about 70%. According to such experimental results we can con- Fig. 2.

Fraunhofer Diffraction in a Refractive Index Matched GRISM Dispersive System Fig. 3 shows the outline of our GRISM disperse system. We have balanced the polarization angle ϕ in equation (7) with the diffraction angle 1ϕ  which is the angle of the first order spectrum which is of the greatest intensity, thus satisfy- ing the condition . 1ϕϕ= Meanwhile, the maximum condition of a refractive index modulation HDG is satisfied if the incident light enters at Bragg angle. At that time the Bragg angle can be expressed as － 28 － The Fraunhofer Diffraction occurring in a Refractive Index Matched GRISM based on HDG =θB 2/( arcsin [ Λλ )] where Λ is the spatial period and Bθ is the Bragg angle(Fig. 4). Fig. 3. Polarization of light in a GRISM disperse system Fig. 4. Bragg diffraction in the HDG So for the given GRISM disperse system the following expression holds true. = B 2 θϕ 1 = [ 2arcsin 2/( Λλ )] ( n= − 1) δ (8) According to expression (8), the relationship between the spatial period of the HDG and the prism’s apical angle should be expressed as Λ = λ n − 2sin[ ( δ ]2/1) .              (9) According to equation (9) the relation between HDG spatial period and the prism's apical angle is shown in Fig 5. As shown in Fig.5 in case that the spatial frequency , a , thus the spatial period is 1mm − 3.33 300 m Λ = μ is =ν prism with the apical angle the GRISM. If the spatial frequency is if the spatial period is is the best choice for , thus , a prism with the api- 1mm − 1.67 =ν 600 m Λ = μ (cid:68)17=δ cal angle of =δ 33° is the best choice. Refractive index matching is implemented by Cana- dian balsam ( =n )52.1 . Fig. 5. Change of HDG spatial pe- riod according to the prism’s apical angle The consequent GRISM has excellent disperse charac- teristics, is much stable against dampness and no change in photochemical sensitivity has been detected in the ultraviolet exposure experiment with EHV mercury lamp “ДРЩ-250”. The experimental results show that GRISM based on a refractive index modulation phase HDG is a new and reasonably good combination method of dispersive elements. Conclusion  On the basis of investigation of the Fraunhofer diffraction characteristics in a slit-prism optical system, we have found a reasonable refractive index matching condition for the com- position of a GRISM, a new style of dispersive element. － 29 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 4 Juche103(2014) the prism material is 52.1=n Since the refractive index of the HDG's emulsion is and the refractive index of 52.1=n , phase-matching with Canadian balsam of the refractive index 52.1=n is an effective way to compose a GRISM as a new direct-view dispersive element. And we have found evidence that it is a reasonable solution to the problem of dispersive system stabilization to compose a GRISM disperse system by phase-matching based on refrac- tive index modulation HDG.
