Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 4 Juche103(2014) Efficiency of Treatment of Maize Seed by Active Phosphoric Acid Solution Choe Hak Gwon, Pak Ji Sam and Kim Mun Il Abstract Active phosphoric acid solution was made and applied to maize seed, and then the activity of peroxidase was inhibited by 54.7 % and respiration rate decreased by 19 % at germination, therefore, nutrient of germplasm is retained for a long time, the growth of maize become excellent and eventually, the maize yield increased by 110 %. Key words maize, active phosphoric acid solution, peroxidase  Introduction  Phosphorus is a nutrient element that is necessary for forming of ATP, nucleotide, nucleic acid Phosphorus becomes active in plant and facilitates the tillering, root growth, flowering and and phosphorus lipid. maturation [2]. Characteristic symptoms of phosphorus lack are that the growth of young plant is slow and to appear dark green color, deformed leaves and leaf spots [3, 4]. Supplementary symptoms of phosphorus lack are that stems are thin, many leaves don’t exist, old leaves are died quickly, a course of growth is slow and leaf color is purple with dark green.[1] We have studied to produce active phosphoric acid solution and investigate growth, yield characteristics and economic efficiency when active phosphoric acid solution is applied to maize seed.  1. Production and Analysis Methods of Active Phosphoric Acid Solution 1.1. Production of active phosphoric acid solution First, MnSO4 .4H2O 24mg, CuSO4 .5H2O 18mg, (NH4)6Mo7O24 .4H2O 2.5mg are diluted with a liter of 0.2% H3PO4 solution.(SolutionⅠ) Next, 2 kg of CaSO4 dried with 10% water content are put in 4 liter water, then after 24 hours, the supernatant liquid from complex solution is mixed with solutionⅠ20 mL and use it as undiluted liquid. 1.2. Analysis method of active phosphoric acid solution Phosphorus absorption quality of maize seed is measured by auto analysis tool (“EPARD”) and activity of peroxidase by Gwayakol method, respiration rate by Warbourg method. And water absorption capacity of root is measured by the method that calculates the titration concentration of methylen blue in salt water with different concentration and osmotic pressure of the certain solution. － 91 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 4 Juche103(2014) 2.

Effects of peroxidase activity of maize seed according to active phosphoric acid treatment are as follows (table 2). Table 2.

There are cytokrom oxidation en- zymes except peroxidase in enzymes that include iron in active unit among the respiration enzymes of crops and it shows that active phosphoric acid solution  treatment inhibites peroxidase activity specially. Effect on respiration of maize leaf by active phosphoric acid solution treatment was investigated (table 3). Table 3.

Effects on water absorption of maize roots by active phosphoric acid solution treatment are as follows (table 4). Table 4. Effects on water absorption of maize roots by active phosphoric acid solution treatment Group Control Treatment Water absorption capacity/MPa Difference －2.33 －4.02 － －1.69 Rate/% 100 172.5 Laboratory condition: it is same as table 2, survey: 5 leaves As shown in table 4, water absorption capacity enhances as 172.5% by increasing 1.69Mpa in active phosphoric acid solution treatment than control. This means that absorption of water and nutrients is enhanced due to increasement of solution density of root cell by active phosphoric acid solution. 2.2. Variation of growth and yield of maize in active phosphoric acid solution treatment In the active phosphoric acid treatment for maize seed, capacity of germination is as high as 3.3 % and rate of germination 3.6% and germination is equal than Control, and leaf color is clear green than Control with the naked eye. Growth changes of maize by the active phosphoric acid solution treatment are as follows (table 5). Table 5.

As shown in table 5, in control, the end of leaf is dried, but didn’t appear in the active phosphoric acid solution, living leaf number is more emerged 1 leaf and root length, root number and air root number of maize is more emerged than Control. After treating maize by the active phosphoric acid solution, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content in root, leaf and stem are as follows.(table 6) Table 6.

As you can see in table 7, in the active phosphoric acid solution treatment group, ear length is 2.9cm longer , and grain number filling with seed per ear is more 14.2 grains, 1 000 grain mass is more 30.2g heavier therefore, the yield of maize is 110.3%, 870kg /ha is more increased. Also, starch content is more enhanced as 2.6%, whole starch content is more enhanced as 0.7%, therefore, quality of maize grain is promoted. Conclusion  The maize seeds soaking in 20 or 25℃ water for 5 or 10 hours were treated with 0.3% active phosphoric acid solution for 1 hour and then gives affirmative effects on physiological indices and yield, and yield per ha was increased by 110%.
