Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 4 Juche103(2014) On the Stress State Analysis of Damage Materials with Voids and Elliptical Cracks Ri Chol Su, Im Chung Hyok Abstract We have considered mechanical modeling of damage materials including voids and 3-dimensional elliptical cracks based on a coupling damage model of void and crack. We represented voids in material using the damage tensor based on concept of effective stress and modeled the elliptical cracks based on exact crack theory. According to this modeling, we determined characteristic quantity of stiffness in damage material and analyzed the stress state of damage material with voids and elliptical cracks. Key words elliptical crack, void, damage  Introduction  Generally, some materials such as concrete and rock are the damage materials where exist various discontinuities such as micro-voids and cracks simultaneously. The methods of continuum damage theory and micro mechanical damage theory were considered as the methods to evaluate the mechanical state of damage material. The continuum damage mechanics is not related with physical background of damage and micro structural change inside of material, but represents the cracks, gaps and cavities as a concept of damage from phenomenological point of view and constructs the damage constitu- tive equation and evolution equation of materials by introducing damage factor in forms of scalar, vector or tensor and predicts the strain and fracture progress of material theoreti- cally[3]. In reference [4] the void and crack damage parameter was represented as different dam- age parameters on damage material with voids, cracks, considered their relation with total damage parameter, and applied the relation to analyze mechanical state of fiber-reinforced so- lidification composite material with void and crack damage. On the other hand, unlike void damage, the micromechanical damage theory to solve damage problem on crack damage was proposed and many studies have been performed. Micromechanical damage theory gives the comparatively clear mechanical background for the damage factor and the damage evolution law by including geometrical and mechanical characteristics of various micro-damage of material. In order to estimate the effective elastic modulus of solid including microcracks by mi- cromechanical damage theory, the equivalent effective medium method is used usually. In this method the microcrack is considered to be in a equivalent elastic medium and － 9 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 4 Juche103(2014) assumption in which this method is effected is to recognize that external field around each microcrack is considered to be independent of correct position of microcrack. There are several typical methods to estimate effective elastic characteristics of solid in- cluding microcrack. These are Taylor method or DCM(Dilute Concentration Method), SCM(Self-Consistent Method), the simplest method which neglects interaction between microde- fects perfectly, DM(Differential Method), Mori-Tanaka method, GSCM(Generalized SCM), the Hashin-Shtrikman limit method which consider weak interaction between microdefects and the statistical micromechanics method which considers strong interaction between microdefects and so on[6]. Taylor method(or DCM) neglects interaction between microcrack, assuming that each microcrack is in elastic basis medium without damage and the force acting to microcrack equals to long distance stress field, and has sufficient accuracy under condition of infrequent microcrack. SCM (Self-Consistent Method) was proposed to consider weak interaction between micro- crack and represents damage in terms of a scalar variable, which is crack density and has comparative simple form and high accuracy. In reference [7] they have determined compliance matrix of cracked material by quasi- micromechanical method (Mori-Tanaka method) on brittle solid with microcrack. In this method the strain of element is considered as the sum of matrix strain and variation of global average strain caused due to crack, which was represented by average displacement discontinu- ity of crack face. But since mechanical states of void and crack are different from each other, the stress- strain state of damage material including voids and cracks can not be considered by only con- tinuum damage theory and micromechanical damage theory exactly. In order to solve this shortcoming, the coupling damage model of voids and cracks was proposed, where the void damage within material was represented by using damage tensor based on the concept of effective stress and the plane cracks by using crack theory. On the basis of it the structural analysis method of plane problem was considered [1, 2].  In this paper, we determined the effective elastic stiffness characteristic quantities of dam- age material including voids and 3-dimensional elliptical crack on the basis of coupling dam- age model of voids and cracks and analyzed the stresses and displacements of damage mate- rial by using ANSYS on the basis of it. 1. The Coupling Damage Model of Damage Material including Voids and Elliptical Cracks Let assume that size of an element is so enough big to involve the voids and cracks in it and is much smaller than structural size to represent the change of stress and strain in structure. － 10 － On the Stress State Analysis of Damage Materials with Voids and Elliptical Cracks According to the coupling damage model of voids and cracks, strain energy U for the elastic material including voids and cracks is represented as follows[1]. = Δ− 2/ U C ) 0 ipkl εε kl ij V c ( σ ij φ pj where = δφ pj pj D− pj is damage effect tensor, pjδ -Kronecker delta, (1) pjD -damage tensor, 0 ipklC - elastic coefficient tensor of material without damage, which is related with effective stress tensor ijσ ( cVΔ σφσ = ip pj ij -complementary energy due to crack, ) reflecting the effect of void damage on effective crack damage element obtained by removing the voids in the element(Fig. 1).
