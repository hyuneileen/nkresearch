Measurement of Energy Spectrum by Nuclear -Resonance Analyzer Ro Chun Hwan, Kim Jin Guk In the past we considered the Mossbauer effect using spectrum analyzer, but we never mentioned the nuclear spectrum data and only considered about property of the Mossbauer analyzer based on 8 channel differential discriminator [1]. We carry out the measurement experiment of energy spectrum of standard sources and sources by the nuclear resonance analyzer based on the 8 channel differential low energy discriminator and confirmed that it can be used in both energy spectrum and Mossbauer spec- trum measurement. 1. The Energy Spectrum Measurement of Standard Sources We measured energy spectrum by means of the standard order to evaluate an energy analisation property by nuclear sources in resonance analyzer that we in- and vestigated and manufactured. Scintillation detector based on NaI scintillator and photo ampli- fier “ФЭУ-93” as the detector was used and high voltage of － 1 300V was given to the cathode of its detector. We set up the amplifying coefficient of the linear amplifier as 3 and conducted the ex- periment for 5min. on 256 channels and the result was shown at Fig. 1, Fig. 2.

The position of the whole absorption picks and the corresponding energy and channel-energy coefficients are shown in the Table 1. The result of calculation of the mean coefficient from table1 is as follows. The integral non-linearity(%) is Table 1.

Here, we caught 5 points and  line and determined the position of the pick to be the cross of that line and drew the axis of channel. Then =107.20 channel and a half width is as follows. From that, the resolution is 2. The Energy Spectrum Measurement of Low Energy Sources The energy range of Mossbauer isotopes is generally below 150keV. So in order to -ray of low energy. In experiment measure Messbauer spectrum it is necessary to measure we measured spectrum of 241Am (17.8, 26.3, 59.5keV), 239Pu (53keV) and 57Co (14.4, 122, 136keV) as low energy sources and analyzed it. We used scintillation detector based on 1.0mm NaI (Tl) scintillator and photomultiple tube “ФЭУ-93” as low energy -ray. We set -ray at detector windows and in order to the Be window of 0.1mm for the reduction of reduce absorption of the -ray into source self we used disk form 239Pu, 241Am source of thickness 1.5, 2.0mm and thin 57Co source of mass width 20mmg/cm2 that was made by ab- sorption of CoCl2(57Co 17.3%) solution into filter paper. The radioactivity of used 241Am, 239Pu, 57Co sources are respectively . Energy spectrum of 241Am measured in 5min is as Fig. 3. Energy spectrum of 239Pu measured for 20min in the same condition is as Fig. 4. Energy spectrum of 57Co measured for 2min in the same condition is as Fig. 5. As shown in the Fig. 3－5, three picks of 17.8, 26.3, 59.5keV was separated obviously on 241Am and one pick of 53keV on -ray spectrum of 239Pu was observed. － 67 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche103(2014) In the mean time, two picks of 14.4keV and 122keV were detected but two picks of 122keV and 136keV were not detected. This is because the resolution of the detector is not high. Energy difference of 122keV and 136keV is small and relative intensity (91%) of 122KeV ray is much bigger than relative intensity(9%) of 136KeV ray. The relation between the whole obtained absorption pick and energy is shown in Ta- Table 2.
