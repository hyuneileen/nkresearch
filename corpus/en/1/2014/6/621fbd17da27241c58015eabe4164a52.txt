Determination of the Local Contrast of Interference Fringe Patterns using continuous Wavelet Transform Jong Kwang Hyok, Kim Chol Su In optical interferometry, the physical quantities to be considered modulate the intensity of the fringe patterns as follows. ,          (1) where is the background intensity,  is the local contrast, and  is the optical phase related to the physical quantities represents the intensity of the pattern image, to be considered. In interferometry phase retrieval from the fringe pattern is therefore essential if one wants to recover the physical quantities to be considered. To recover the phase information from a single interferogram requires that it should be modulated with a suitable spatial carrier frequency. But as shown in Eq. (1), the fringe quali- and it is important to determine it to en- ty is strongly influenced by local contrast hance the accuracy of fringe analysis. For these type of fringe pattern there are three well known methods for phase recovery and fringe contrast, namely Fourier transform method[1], the windowed Fourier transform [2, 3] and wavelet transform [4]. The Fourier transform method is based on the filtering of Fourier spectrum of the fringe pattern. But in the case of rapid variation of spatial frequency or direction of fringe pattern, it is difficult to filter the effective spectrum accurately only by Fourier transform. Furthermore, in Fourier transform method it is impossible to verify the corresponding relation between local intensities and local fringe frequencies. Therefore it is difficult to separate DC component and noise spectrum from effective spectrum and to analyze a local area of fringe pattern. In the windowed Fourier transform, it is possible to analyze the local character of the fringe pattern. But in the case of rapid variation of spatial frequency, the accuracy of fringe analysis is not so high because of the fixed size of window. Modulated fringe patterns can be best described as non-stationary signals with local in- stantaneous frequencies that are proportional to the gradient of the phase distribution of the measured field. The continuous wavelet transform, which is a correlation of a signal with a “mother” wavelet with a certain scale and shift, can be used to verify the correspondence be- tween the local fringe intensity and contrast. 1. Determination of the local contrast of interference fringe patterns  CWT is represented by the correlation between the given signal and wavelet functions [5]. － 49 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche103(2014) ,           (2) where is the coefficient matrix of CWT, is the signal, and is the wavelet function with scale parameter  and shift parameter . The scale parameter describes the feature of fringe, such as fringe frequencies, and the shift parameter specifies a local region where the signal is analyzed. The CWT transforms the signals in the spatial domain into the space-frequency domain. The local signal analysis ap- proach is a major advantage of CWT compared a Fourier transform. Because the CWT is essentially a correlation operation between a signal and a wavelet, the analysis accuracy of the fringe pattern greatly depends on the choice of the mother wave- let function. As shown in Eq. (1), the interference fringe pattern is cosine modulated, so a suitable choice of wavelet function is the complex Morlet wavelet. ,            (3) where is the frequency of the Morlet wavelet. The terms and represent a fast-decaying Guassian envelope and a complex function with sinusoidal character- istics respectively. Eq. (1) can be rewritten in terms of the fringe frequencies as follows The wavelet transform of Eq. (4) using the complex Morlet wavelet is as follows. (4) (5) Because the wavelet transform coefficient is the correlation one, the higher coefficient value is, the more similar the given signal to the wavelet with a certain scale. Thus the max- imal scale value during shifting the wavelet through the fringe pattern is the fringe period and the coefficient value is the contrast of the fringe pattern at this position. Now let the scale value with which the wavelet transform coefficient is maximal be . Then ,                (6) Fig. 1 shows a method of determining the local contrast of fringe pattern by CWT. Fig. 1(a) shows the simulated fringe pattern with a quadric phase and hence a linearly increasing frequency, but different contrast from place to place. Fig. 1(b) shows local fringe contrast dis- tribution obtained by wavelet transform. Because the wavelet function is the complex one, the wavelet coefficients are also complex and therefore their moduli are the fringe contrasts. We changed the scale parameter  of the wavelet transform from 1 to 50 pixels and shifted the position parameter  one by one pixel to get the correlation coefficient between the wavelet function and the given signal. － 50 － Determination of the Local Contrast of Interference Fringe Patterns using… a)                b) Fig. 1.

The CWT transforms the interference fringe pattern into the space-frequency domain. The maximal scale value during shifting the wavelet through the fringe pattern is the fringe period and the coefficient value is the contrast of the fringe pattern at this position. References [1] M.
