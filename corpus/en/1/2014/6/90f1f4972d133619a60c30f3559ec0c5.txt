Rational Positioning of Zoological Gardens with Triangular Fuzzy Numbers Pak Sun Bong, Jon Hye Gyong and Kang Kon Ho The respected Comrade Kim Jong Un said: “We should conduct a regular survey of the species and habitat conditions of the animals and plants that are found in mountains and river basins, and take proactive steps to protect the endangered, rare and other biological species and to preserve biodiversity.” Rational positioning of zoological gardens is one of the most significant issues to provide people with entertainment and to further deepen the research on protecting and increasing an- imal species. The formal decision-making method was commonly used for positioning of construction projects; not much research was done on the soft decision-making method. With triangular fuzzy number we did research into the positioning of zoological gardens with the soft decision-making method. 1. Mathematical Modeling First of all, estimation indices are set for rational positioning. And using the triangular fuzzy number F (l, m, n), the estimation results of the indices are quantitated. Here, The function of F (l, m, n) can be defined as follows. The qualitative factors are then interpreted to triangular fuzzy numbers. The figures are shown in Table 1. Based on Table 1, the sites proposed for zoological gardens are evaluated qualitatively  is formed using the triangular fuzzy number rele- and the matrix of triangular fuzzy numbers vant to the result. － 131 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche 103(2014) Table 1.

And using , the ideal standard inferior triangular fuzzy number is determined. (2) . Next, using equation (1), (2), the ideal inferior triangular fuzzy number and the relative distance between the proposed sites are calculated. The weight of the methods mentioned above is evaluated in general. (3) Finally, using (3), the most rational positioning method is selected. 2. Application We applied this method in positioning of the Y Zoological Garden. Four sites were proposed for the Y Zoological Garden; C, D, A and E. The factors con- － 132 － Rational Positioning of Zoological Gardens with Triangular Fuzzy Numbers sidered in positioning were the distance from the residential areas(X1), traffic conditions(X2), relations with surrounding cultural facilities(X3), conditions for infrastructure(X4), environmental conditions(X5) and the site conditions(X6). Qualitative and quantitative evaluation results of the given indices for the proposed sites are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2.

And using , the ideal standard inferior triangular fuzzy number is determined as follows: Next can be calculated as follows: . can be calculated using (3) and the results are 0.025 8, 0.019 54, 0.024 25, 0.018 45 respectively. As can be seen from the values, the most ideal position for the zoological gar- den is C and E is most unappealing. － 133 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche 103(2014) Conclusion  With triangular fuzzy numbers, the soft decision-making method for zoological gardens can be solved on the scientific basis.
