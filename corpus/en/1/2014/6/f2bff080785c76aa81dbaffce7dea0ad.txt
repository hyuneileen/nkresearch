Numerical Solution of a Voltera Stochastic Integral Equation with Boundary Condition Kim Chon Ul, Ki Ryong Su The great leader Kim Jong Il said: “We must work actively to embrace advanced science and technology. Embracing up-to-date science and technology is an important way to develop national science and technology quickly.” In [2, 4] we considered existence, uniqueness and some properties of the solution of Vol- tera stochastic integral equation, in [1] we considered existence and uniqueness of Voltera sto- chastic integral equation with boundary condition. In [3] we studied existence of solution of boundary value problem.
