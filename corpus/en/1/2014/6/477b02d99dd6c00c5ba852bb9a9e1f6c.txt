Study on the Preparation and Characteristics of the InCdSn Low Temperature Solder for High Power LD Im In Rak, Han Ju Myong The great leader Kim Jong Il said: “Scientists and technicians, basing themselves firmly on reality, must take the problems arising in practical socialist construction as the subjects of their scientific research, and solve the scientific and technological problems appearing in the application of the achievements of their work to production, in a responsible manner.” The miniaturization and increasing power of the semiconductor devices result in increasing demands for the minimizing of thermal resistance and stresses that largely influence reliability  and lifetime of the devices. In recent years, in order to solve this problem, many attempts have been made to devel- op the low temperature solder with small thermal resistance and better ductility [1, 2]. In this work, the lead-free In-Cd-Sn low temperature solder has been prepared and its characteristics have been evaluated in comparison with conventional bonding materials. 1. Preparation of Bonding Materials While alloy materials have low electrical and thermal conductivity compared to individual simple metals, they are more suitable in reliability improvement and in mounting of semicon- ductor devices due to its controllable melting point, ductility and mechanical strength accord- , ing to composition ratios. The melting points of In, Cd and Sn are respectively. Via a change of metal content ratio in alloys we can select the suitable ductility and the melting temperature for improving of device performance. The ductility is improved with increasing In-amount in alloy, but it is easy to oxidize in air, and the wetting property can be deteriorated. On the other hand, increase of Cd-content allows improving the wettabil- ity, but causes raised melting point. By many experiments we have estimated the optimal composition ratio of In:Cd:Sn=35:23:42(wt%) for the operation characteristics and the mounting of devises to fabri- cate. The bonder was prepared as follows: ① Pieces of In, Cd and Sn metals with purity of 99.8% were mixed, charged in a quartz ampoule and sealed with vacuum evacuation. ② The quartz ampoule was kept for an hour at 400℃. － 63 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche103(2014) 2. Results and Discussion The melting temperature of the ternary alloys is 133℃ that is far lower than their components’ ones. Chip bonding experiment of the high power LDs was carried out by means of the prepared low temperature bonder. To prevent the oxidation of bonder, the semiconductor chips have been bonded in the H2 environment. Bonding temperature, pressure  and 2s, respectively. In a case of bonding on the chip and bonding time are  in atmosphere, the bonding materials were compressively shaped in sheets of 50 ～ 100 , thickness, dipped in the resin-ethanol solution and pulled out, and then dried at room tempera- ture. By using this method the resin film on the sheet-shaped bonder was formed. Thermal fa- tigue in soldered areas was examined in two solder alloys: 35In-23Cd-42Sn solder and 63Sn- 37Pb solder (as a reference). For the thermal fatigue testing the periodical repeat of tempera- ture increase-decrease from was carried out 50 and 100 times. to As shown in Fig. 1, after cycle test- ing the pull strength (bonding strength) of 35In-23Cd-42Sn solder at the soldered are- as is constant, but one of 63Sn-37Pb sol- der was decreased significantly. The microscopic investigation after fa- tigue testing shows that solder has a re- markable tendency to develop cracks during temperature cycle testing, but no change was observed in the micro-structure of the  solder after temperature Fig. 1.

The attach strength of the conventional bonder after fatigue testing deceases remarkably, but, in case of ternary alloy, is alloy with melting point of nearly invariable and shows no crack development, and also has high ductility.
