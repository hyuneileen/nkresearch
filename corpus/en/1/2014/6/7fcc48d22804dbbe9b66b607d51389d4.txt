Study on Seasonal Cycle of Stewartia koreanna Nak. a Plant Indigenous to Korea Ri Hyang, Ri Kum Ok The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said: “In particular, great efforts should be exerted to protecting and increasing those animals and plants which are indigenous only to our country and those which are rare and small in number.” Stewartia koreanna Nak is a wild plant indigenous to Korea. It grows only in the moun- tainous region of Unchang-ri, Yangdok County in the northern part of Korea. For its big beautiful flowers and strong look, it is cultivated mainly for ornament. The paper is on the seasonal phase of Stewartia koreanna Nak. 1. Materials and Method Stewartia koreanna Nak. that grows in Unchang-ri, Yangdok County and in the Unjong Botanical Garden was used for study. On the basis of the precedent research findings on Stewartia koreanna Nak. [1－3], the study was done on its 5 seasonal phases; vegetative growth, bud-forming, flowering, fruition, the end of the vegetative growth which were again subdivided. The table of seasonal phase of a year set March 1 as the beginning date, with reference to literature [1]. The average of seasonal days of the successive years was calculated by using the formula M=Ex/n. In this formula, M stands for the average of seasonal days of the successive years (d), for the seasonal days of the successive years (d), and  for the number of years. 2. Results and Consideration 2.1. A yearly change in the seasonal phases of the Stewartia koreanna Nak. Table 1 shows the changes in the yearly phenophase of the Stewartia koreanna Nak growing in the natural habitat in Unchang-ri, Yangdok County and those growing in the Un- jong botanical garden, Phyongsong City. As shown in table 1, the early seasonal phases (periods for vegetative growth, bud- forming, flowering) start earlier in the Unjong botanical garden where the average annual tem- perature is comparatively high, and the late phases (fruition, end of vegetative growth) end earlier in Yangdok area where the average annual temperature is comparatively low. － 92 － Study on Seasonal Cycle of Stewartia koreanna Nak. a Plant Indigenous to Korea Table 1.

It ends in November when the monthly mean temperature falls below 10℃. Nearly all leaves fall by Nov 10 in Yangdok and Nov 25 in the Unjong botanical garden. At the stage of developing sexual organ, flowering period is from June 29 to July 16 in Yangdok and from June 7 to July 10 in the Unjong botanical garden. Monthly mean tempera- ture during the flowering period is 20~24℃. Fruition period is from July 1 to November 8 in Yangdok area and from June 27 to Nov 15 in the Unjong botanical garden. Fruit-maturing period at the phase of fruition is from Sep- tember 21 to October 27 in Yangdok and from September 17 to October 20 in the Unjong botanical garden where fruit ripen earlier. However the fruit-falling period starts earlier in Yangdok and there were some cases there in which immature seeds fell due to the weather condition. 2.2. Average seasonal days of the Stewartia koreanna Nak. of the successive years At the stage when leaves start to grow the average days of the successive years are as follows (table 2). Table 2. Seasonal days at the stage that leaves begin to come out Inspection Year Period when the leaves  begin to Grow/M.Day Seasonal day from 1st March/d 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 N=5 4.20 4.18 4.19 4.21 4.21 0.2 －1.8 －0.8 1.8 1.8 51 49 50 52 52 ∑X=254 As shown in table 2, n is 5 and ∑X=254. So yearly key mean seasonal day (M) for the Stewartia koreanna Nak. at the stage in which leaves start to come out is as follows; The leaves of the Stewartia koreanna Nak. start to come out within 51 days on average from March 1. According to Table 1 it falls on April 20. In the same way, the beginning and end of each seasonal phase and sub-phases of the Stewartia koreanna Nak. were calculated from the mean duration of its phenophase for the successive years as in table 3. － 94 － Study on Seasonal Cycle of Stewartia koreanna Nak. a Plant Indigenous to Korea Table 3.

Other yearly key mean seasonal day and dates when sub-phases start and end, the seasonal duration starting from March 1 are given in the table. Conclusion  By studying the seasonal phase of the Stewartia koreanna Nak., a plant indigenous to Korea, the time when each seasonal phase and the sub-phase starts and their duration were clarified, to provides reference data for the effective use of its ornamental aspect and effective technical maintenance such as seed collection and cultivation.
