Establishment of the Selectivity Index in Flotation Process Choe Myong Ryong, Jo Tong Su and Kim Sung Hyok The flotation process is the process of concentrating the targeted valuable mineral compo- nents so it requires the maximum productivity and concentration. The index, called concentrating efficiency at presence, has been defined as the d recovery difference of values between gangues carried by froth, (1) where  is concentrating efficiency, and are recoveries of valuable mineral and gangue respectively [3]. The concentrating efficiency was introduced in order to consider the recovery of gangue in concentrate because the recovery of concentrate reflects the quantitive aspect on- ly. However the index has some defects. If the valuable component is one, the concentrating efficiency can be written as, (2) where is concentrate recovery, is grade of feed. Equation (2) was derived from mass balance equations for the concentrate recovery and gangue one, (3) (4) where is the grade of concentrate. As seen from Eq. (3) and (4), is involved in both equations. It shows that the quantitative index and qualitative index were not defined strictly. In addition, it is not analytical derivation that the gangue recovery is subtracted from the con- centrate recovery. That is subjective intention to estimate the qualitative aspect in the same dimension of concentrate recovery. There are some attempts to quantitify strictly the separating degree of concentrate from gangue. In the literature [4], omega-transformation applied from the character of flotation pro- cess which the lower grade of tailings is, more difficult to decrease that is, or the higher grade of concentrate is, more difficult to increase that is. As reported in literature [4], because － 75 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche 103(2014) the grade of concentrate and tailing, concentrate recovery and yield are varied at every stage and so the concentrating efficiency value is varied, it is difficult to apply the index to optimi- zation of flotation process. 1. Dynamic Characteristics of Selectivity In every stage, the values of flotation indices are varied regular because the selectivity of flotation is dynamic variable. The various types of rate equation related to flotation rate in aspect of flotation engineering [5 － 7]. Based on the parabolic model of flotation rate equa- tion[1], we proposed the flotation rate equation [2], (5) (6) where are kinetics parameters. is reciprocal of rate constant (initial rate). From the Eq. (5), (6), (7) Eq. (7) shows the change of valuable minerals recovery. Parameter A, B are defined as follow: (8) 2. The Analytical Basis of Selectivity The well known equation shows that the concentrate recovery is a function of the yield and rich ratio, ( : grading ratio, : concentrate grade)    (9) . From the total differential of Equation (3) the differential of recovery is given by: The differential form of Eq. (5) is ,              (10) (11) (12) Eq. (6) shows that the flotation rate ( ) and the rate ) is related to yield rate ( ). We define this relationship as the correlation rule of flotation rate. of rich ratio change ( － 76 － Establishment of the Selectivity Index in Flotation Process As Eq. (6) shows, the flotation rate can’t be higher than because the value of the first term in the right side is negative. On the other hand, from Eq. (5) the other differential form is given by: (13) (14) Eq. (14) doesn’t show recovery change vs. yield change, but also how the rich ratio changes with yield in flotation. Eq. (7) represents the kinetics property unlike separating effi- ciency. In order to avoid confusion we defined left side of Eq. (7) as grading ratio as follows; (15) We called SE as differential concentrating ratio.  3. Meaning Concentrating Ratio The grading ratio is a dynamic concept, because of . The grading ratio is essentially a ratio of flotation rate and yield rate at given time. This variable is related to rich ratio, but is different from it. Consequently, the method that evalu- ates the reagent systems by comparing the values of rich ratios is reasonable at only initial time. If the flotation rate and yield rate equation are known, the grading ratio can be calculat- ed easily at arbitrary time and yield using its kinetics parameters. A lot of flotation rate equa- tion model involving the first-order model were proposed.[3-5] Using the precedent research result that the flotation rate and yield rate are according to parabolic model, the grading ratio can be as follows: (16) According to parabolic model, recovery vs. time and yield vs. time equation can be writ- ten as The function converted from Eq. (9) and (10) is given below. － 77 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche 103(2014) The rewritten equation is where, , . (17) Based on the Eq. (12), the grading ratio can be lead as follow or hand from Eq. (12) Parameter B means a ratio of initial yield rate and initial recovery rate. On the other (18) When value of equals 1, also equals 1 and so . The grading ratio S is ratio of recovery rate and yield rate, so that it is discussed at a given time and overall flota- tion process can not be evaluated by itself. However, parameter A and B can become indexes that evaluate flotation process. The value of parameter B is in range of 0～1 and the smaller its value is, the higher selectivity is. In contrast, the bigger value of A is, the higher selectiv- ity is. Arrangement of Eq. (15) introduced results in (19) where is the grade of concentrate, is reciprocal of rich ratio, K. The parameter A is related to both the rich rate and yield and the bigger value of yield and rich ratio are, the bigger its value is. It shows obviously that its physical mean differs from separating efficiency. (See Eq. (2)) We call the parameter A, grading degree and defined it as the selectivity index of flotation process. Conclusion  We considered the dynamic mean of selectivity and indicated that the selectivity of over- all process could not be evaluated by the separating efficiency and rich ratio. We proposed the concept of grading degree that characterized the dynamic selectivity of flotation based on the parabolic model. References  [1] [2] 종합대학학보(자연과학), 53, 6, 104, 주체96(2007).
