Characteristics of Temperature Control of CdTe Crystal Growth Furnace by Vertical Bridgman(VB) Method Choe Sam Hyok, Chon Chang Won and Kim Ryong Jin For the CdTe crystal growth by Vertical Bridgman (VB) Method, we made an apparatus for temperature control which sets a temperature control curve in advance for a furnace and grows and anneals crystals simultaneously. We also realized the PID automatic temperature con- trol. 1. Apparatus for Temperature Control of a CdTe Crystal Growth Furnace CdTe(CT) is widely used as -ray detection material because of its high -ray adsorp- tion ability [1, 2]. What is important here is to grow high-quality CdTe crystal, for which temperature con- trol and heat annealing should be done correctly [3]. First, an apparatus to enhance the accuracy of temperature control was made. When growing CdTe crystal by VB method, the temperature is as high as 1 050℃. To measure this temperature, we used chromel-alumel thermocouple. Signals from this were con- verted into digital signal with AD conversion, input into a computer to sense the temperature.  As high AD conversion bits is essential in enhancing the accuracy of temperature control, the temperature control apparatus was made using AD7705, 16bit AD converter. The AD7705 is the 16 bit serial data output AD conversion device with 2 analog input channels which adjusts gain programmatically. The AD7705 pin configuration is shown in Fig. 1. The function of each is given below; SCLK: Serial Clock MCLK IN: Master Clock Signal Input of 500kHz～5MHz MCLK OUT: Master Clock Signal Output : Chip Select : Reset AIN2(+): Positive Input of the Analog signal(+) AIN1(+):Positive Input of the Analog signal(+) AIN1(-): Negative Input of the Analog signal(-) GND: Ground Reference Point VDD: Supply Voltage DIN: Serial Data Input － 60 － Fig. 1.

The inter- face is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. STC89C52 to AD7705 interface As is shown in the diagram, the STC89C52 out- puts the serial clock signals via P1.2 pin, transmits and receives serial data signals via P1.3 pin and P1.4 pin. When the AD conversion is finished in AD7705, the data signals are input to the microcontroller via P3.2 pin, and then it reads the serial data from P1.3 pin and knows the value of the AD conversion. The algorithm for driving the AD7705 is shown in Fig. 3. 2. Temperature Control in Crystal Growing and Heat Annealing In VB method, the quality of the crystal is en- hanced by growing CdTe crystal in 1 050℃ and treat- ing with heat/annealing the grown crystal in various temperatures, thus eliminating Cd vacan- cies [3]. Fig. 3. Algorithm for driving AD7705 We set in advance a time-temperature curve for the crystal growth furnace and realized highly accurate PID automatic temperature control. In order to ensure high precision through the whole process of temperature control, P, I, D coefficients according to temperature should be determined correctly. We determined the P, I, D coefficients by measuring the thermal inertia of the furnace at intervals of 100℃/at every 100℃ and as for the P, I, D coefficients of non-measured temper- atures by linear interpolation of the determined PID coefficients. The measured P, I, D coeffi- cients are shown in Table. － 61 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche 103(2014) Coefficients Table.
