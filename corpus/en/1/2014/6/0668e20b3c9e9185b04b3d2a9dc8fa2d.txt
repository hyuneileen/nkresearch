A Method of Hot Rolling Process Scheduling using Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem Kang Ho Gyong, Jon Jae Gyong Making production schedules in hot rolling production processes is of great importance for production management. Up to now, there have been many researches into production schedules in rolling produc- tion processes. However, those methods are not yet developed satisfactorily since each method needs some specific conditions for its use and has some limitations. Some literatures [1, 2] have considered rolling scheduling models and their solving meth- ods for enhancement of products’ standard package and productivity for a continuous rolling production processes. Literatures [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] proposed optimal methods for generating approximate optimal solutions for models of hot rolling scheduling problem. Literatures [8, 9, 10] proposed more appropriate models for finding out optimal solutions by optimal search techniques. lows. The shortcomings of preceding methods for the hot rolling scheduling problem are as fol- First, the previous researches mostly conducted analysis of models for the continuous hot rolling production processes but didn’t consider models for the hot blooming rolling production processes. Second, there has never been a detailed research enough for models of the hot blooming rolling production processes. So there could be no solution of methods for the models. Therefore we conduct modeling for hot blooming rolling production processes by using multiple traveling salesman problems and propose a solving method with GA. 1. MTSP Model of the Hot Rolling Scheduling Problem The blooming mill is often considered as the bottleneck of the overall production process, and in conformity with the different gauges of products, roll grooves must be replaced in production processes. Therefore, arise problems such as increment of roll groove replacement cost, production time and energy consumption. － 29 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche103(2014) Hot rolling scheduling of the blooming mill is a framing of production turns reflected with rolling sequence of slabs to roll in a shift. Production turn means the continuous produc- tion in conformity with settled gauges by means of one kind of roll groove. First, to convert hot rolling scheduling into an MTSP, we introduce M dummy nodes. One of them let all turns start from it and end at it. That is, this dummy node acts as both of source node and destination node to make closed routes. Then M － 1 dummy nodes are introduced to ensure that M closed routes are made and every node should be visited by only one salesman. Assume that N slabs with numbers (slabs assigned number) are to be rolled in M rolling turns on one shift. Then, these N slabs with numbers may be viewed as N nodes and M turns may be re- garded as the tours by M traveling salesmen. That is, N slabs with numbers are correspond to  N cities to be visited by M roll grooves. By adding M dummy nodes , the rolling scheduling problem can be viewed as an MTSP. Now, assume that one salesman visit cities MTSP can then be reduced to a single TSP. These variables and parameters may be viewed as three kinds of numerical formula. , , , (1) (2) (3) Appling (penalty constant for production changeover from slab with number directly to slab with number ), the mathematical model of blooming rolling scheduling can then be formulated as follows: Objective function: Subject to － 30 － A Method of Hot Rolling Process Scheduling using Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (4) (5) Constraints (2) ensure that only one task is rolled before order . Constraints (3) guaran- tee that only one slab is rolled after slab . Constraints (4) makes avoid subschedules (corre- sponding to subtours for TSP) in the feasible solutions. Constraints (5) means that the varia- bles only take integer values of 0 or 1. The solution of this model gives a complete schedule consisting of turns for each start from a dummy node and the complete schedule corresponds to a optimal path in the TSP.  2. Solving Method for TSP Model with GA A general GA for TSP may be described as follows. First, we use general coding method that an object(genotype) corresponds to an appro- priate traveling path(phenotype). Assume N slabs with numbers are cities with assigned and gives numbers 1 to N to be visited, then visiting sequence is viewed as city’s list any number in unvisited city’s list (positive numbers) appropriately arranged. Then represent th visited city for  and assume it is gene . At this time,  as a chromosome is concluded. Thus, let the acquired list and form a GA. Second, crossover method uses partially mapped crossover (PMC) which is one kind of crossover operation method. PMC adds to point to point crossover procedure which keep cor- and consid- rectness of permutation. Suppose phenotype (path) is permutation er it as genotypes. At this time, genotypes of two parent generations and are generated by PMC and that procedure and as , respectively, then two descendant and is as follows. ① Arbitrarily select two-crossover point. ② Parent copy genes to descendants respectively. Therefore ③ First, find the value of  satisfying for interspace between crossover points , and value of  satisfying . Then replace with . Last, mutation operation uses general method in which two gene’s positions are selected Purpose function is not negative and the purpose is minimization, then, fitness function is randomly. as follows. － 31 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche103(2014) 3. A Numerical Results We made a hot rolling schedule with production data of blooming rolling processes and its purpose is minimization of penalty cost. Parameters are set as follows. Maximum number of generations=100, Population size=10, Probability of crossover=0.99, Probability of mutation=0.01. Penalty structure for rolling gauge considers specific characters and various constraints of the object are shown in Table 1. Then, Table 2 shows actual rolling sequence made by man- ual agent and proposed method. The object function value of manual rolling sequence table is 120 and the object function value of MTSP rolling sequence table is 80, so it is clear that the total penalty of the solu- tion by proposed method is far less than that by manual sequencing. In this experiment the total penalty of the schedule generated by the MTSP/GA method has decreased by 33.4% as compared with the result of manual scheduling. Table １．Rolling gauge penalty structure This result demonstrates that a hot rolling schedule produced with the proposed MTSP/GA is superior to one created from the manual experience. Table 2.
