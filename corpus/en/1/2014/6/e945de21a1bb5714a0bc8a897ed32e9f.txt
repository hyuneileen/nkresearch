The Effect of Hypericum perforatum Extract on Several Physical Indices for Growth of Rats Pak Song Chol, Min Pyong Ha and Nam Hye Ryon The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said: “We should collect different kinds of medicinal herbs abundant in our country, create many herb garden, and build up production bases of Koryo medicines, so as to produce plenty of them as needed to protect and promote the people’s health.” Hypericum perforatum, a perennial herb with unique pharmacological substances, is being widely used for prevention and treatment of various diseases in many countries. In recent years, the result of the intensive studies on Hypericum perforatum mechanism of this herb’s pharmacological effects is worked out and the scope of its usage is extending. However, there has never been any report on its effect on the growth of animals, especially on the growth indices including the weight of pituitary gland and the content of growth hormone (GH) of white rats [1, 2]. Therefore, we worked to clarify the effect of Hypericum perforatum extract on several physiological indices for growth of rats. 1. Materials and Methods Hypericum perforatum extract used for the experiment is from the the whole herb which had been harvested in early July (blooming period) and dry-grinded. 40 rats with the average weight of about 75g were divided into a control group and 3 test groups and were experimented for 30 consecutive days. Rats in test groups were fed feed with Hypericum perforatum extract added in doses of 100, 200, 300mg/kg respectively for 1kg of body weight, while the control group were fed feed with nothing added. The same conditions were provided for both control and test groups including their feeding quantity. On the last day of the test, we decided on the optimal dose by measuring the change in body weight. We also dissected rats in control group and in test groups in which the optimal dose was applied in order to measure the weight of pituitary gland and the concentration of GH. GH was isolated by polyacrylamide gel–electrophoresis, and its concentration was meas- ured by spectrometric assay. GH secretion was evaluated by measuring the thickness of carti- lage of the neck bones, their length and weight and weights of several organs. － 89 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche103(2014) 2.

This shows that Hypericum perforatum extract increased weight of pituitary gland and GH content in rats. 2.2. The effect of Hypericum perforatum extract on the growth of tibiotarsus We removed the neck bones of the rats in both control and test groups to for their length and weight and measured the thickness of their cartilage by micrometer (Table 2). Table 2.

It indicates that the acceleration of GH secretion resulted in the stimulation of the growth of tibiotarsus. The expeirment results above prove that Hypericum perforatum extract not only acceler- ates GH synthesis but also strenthens its secretion in the pituitary gland of rats. 2.3.

It indicates that Hypericum perforatum extract increased body weight of rat and the opti- mal dose is 200mg/kg. There are some reports that hypericum and hyperforin, the main pharmacological ingredi- ents of Hypericum perforatum, regulate the activities of monoaminergic neurons in hypothala- mus [1, 2]. From this, it can be considered that Hypericum perforatum extract enhances synthesis and secretion of GH in the anterior lobe of pituitary through monoaminergic neurons in hypothal- amus, so that it can accelerate the growth of animals. Conclusion  Hypericum perforatum extract increases the weight of pituitary gland and stimulates syn- thesis and secretion of GH of rats. Hypericum perforatum extract increases the weights of body and organs of rats.  References [1] M. Franklin et al.; Biol. Psychiatry, 46, 581, 1999. [2] C.
