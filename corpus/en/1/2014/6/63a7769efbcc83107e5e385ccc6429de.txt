Sorting Process and Gravity Concentration Characteristics of Placer Minerals in Coastal Areas Ri Hyang Mi, Ho Ung Ryong and Kim Chol Ju The great leader Kim Jong Il said: “In order to meet the rapidly increasing demand of the national economy for fuel and raw materi- al resources we must put geological prospecting on a modern footing.” In general, placer minerals in coastal areas are formed when initial material sources un- dergo weathering, erosion, transport and sedimentation. Sediments carried into the sea go through constant movement and sedimentation in time and spaces and then they are sorted into grain sizes according to their density differences. [3] We studied the relationship between the sorting process of placer minerals in the seawater vehicle and the gravity concentration character. 1. Sorting Process of Placer Minerals in Coastal Areas In seawater vehicle, when sediment grains of different sizes and of different densities precipitate, heavy grains which precipitated earlier sink in the place while suspended light ones sink as they travel long distances. In this way placer minerals in coastal areas are sorted and sink according to their density and their grain size. On the other hand, sediment grains deposited in a certain place turn into a moving state when hydraulic conditions change, and this critic hydraulic condition is called the starting ve- locity of sediment grains. There are a number of formulas to calculate the starting velocity of sediment grains, but the most appropriate one is the following [1]. (1) (2) where d is the grain class of sediment; cle; g is gravity acceleration; ν is a kinetic coefficient of viscosity of the vehicle; are densities of sediment grain and vehi- is a and coefficient of total friction of wave and is related to bed shear stress. The starting grain size is the size of sediment grain which can move with the starting － 138 － Sorting Process and Gravity Concentration Characteristics of Placer Minerals … velocity. Calculation of the starting grain class is slightly complicated but its final formula is as follows: (3) where is the bed shear stress. Table 1, 2 show velocities of precipitation corresponding to the density and the grain size of the sediments which affect the grain size distribution of placer minerals in coastal areas and the starting velocity according to the depth of water and the starting grain size.

In other words, at a certain point at the bottom of the sea, the sediment grains can be distrib- uted according to the fomula of the sedimenta- tion velocity at one time but can also be dis- tributed according to the formula of the start- ing velocity the other time. This results in the creation of different placer deposits with dif- ferent mineral composition and size. 0.24 0.31 0.35 0.29 0.38 0.42 0.23 0.23 0.26 0.64 0.84 0.95 0.39 0.44 0.46 0.48 0.53 0.57 0.29 0.32 0.35 1.06 1.19 0.28 0.30 0.34 0.37 20 40 60 2. Characteristic of the gravity concentration In laminar and turbulent flow, free settling velocity of the precipitating grain can be cal- culated with the following formula:［2,4］ (4) (5) － 139 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 6 Juche 103(2014) where  and turbulent flow, are free settling velocities of the precipitating grain in the laminar and  is density of the vehicle,  is  is density of the precipitating grain, viscosity of the vehicle, g is the gravity acceleration, d is size of a precipitating grain(density). We can simply put it into formulas (4) and (5). (6) (7) where and are invariables, ( ) is effective density of the precipitating grain whose density in the solution of is . Formulas (6) and (7) show that the settling velocity of the precipitating grain depends on the size and density of the vehicle. Therefore, the ratio of free settling can be worked out with the following formula: (8) where and are sizes of the precipitating grains a and b, and are densities of the precipitating grain a and b. In this formula (8), with Stock's rule, n refers to fine grains and is 0.5, but with New- ton's rule, n, being the coarse grain, is 1. And if n is of a middle size of 50m～0.5cm, it is 0.5～1. In practice, sediment grains are more influenced by hindered settling than free settling. When the amount of grains increases in the pulp, the settling velocity of the grain decreases as the interference between the grains increases. Therefore, we can draw out a new settling velocity formula from the formula (7). (9) where is the density of the pulp. As shown in the formula (9) effective density decreases as the density of the pulp in- creases. And as effective density decreases, the settling velocity decreases. If we change the into in the formula (8), we can draw a new formula to calcu- late the ratio of the sizes of the grains in hindered settling. (10) Formula (10) shows that the ratio of the sizes of the grains in hindered settling is related to the density of the pulp. In other words, the greater the density of pulp, the greater the ratio of the sizes of the grains in hindered settling. Calculation of the ratio of the grain sizes of the coastal placer minerals of different den- sities in hindered settling is shown in table 3. － 140 － Sorting Process and Gravity Concentration Characteristics of Placer Minerals … Table 3.

Conclusion  1) In the coastal areas with placer minerals there exist coarse, middle and fine deposits with different mineral compositions which depend on the extent of the action of hydrodynamic factors which control the process of creating and sorting sediments 2) The greater the ratio of the grain sizes of the coastal placer minerals and the density of the pulp, the greater the effectiveness of gravity concentration in the placer minerals.
