Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 2 Juche103(2014) A Method for Determining Alternative of Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Group Decision Making based on Relationship Analysis between Criteria Jon Jae Gyong, Mun Jong Hui Abstract We presented a solution for determining the optimal alternative based on the relationship analysis between criteria in the group decision-making problem with different forms of information preference of decision-makers on criteria. In particular, we studied the problems that consider more than one criterion in the case that the preference information of the decision-makers are stated by fuzzy numbers, which is known as fuzzy multiple criteria group decision making. Key words fuzzy multiple criteria decision making, criteria, criteria weight  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “Scientists and technicians should intensify their scientific research for the scientific and technical solutions to the problems arising in making the national economy scientifically-based, and thus put the production and management activities of all branches on a new scientific base.”(“KIM JONG IL SELECTED WORKS” Vol. 10 P. 195) Determining optimal alternative in group decision making is very importance in management. Up to now, there are many researches for the group decision making that consider more than one criteria, the multiple objective decision making for optimizing more than one objective and the fuzzy decision making that information are stated by fuzzy number. However, the methods for determining optimal alternative in group decision making are not well developed until now, because each deferent evaluation method has some specific condition for its use and some limitations Some researchers [1, 2] paid their attention to group decision-making problems, in which the decision-makers provide their preference information on alternative using different preference forms. Meanwhile the researches on single-objective optimization model to determine the attribute weights from the interval decision matrix and criteria weight intervals made advance [10]. There are methods that get the optimal alternative by synthesizing conclusions of decision-makers when information of criteria weight is given partially and the degree of satisfaction is expressed by triangle fuzzy number[3－5]. They proposed method for determining the preference of alternative by Borda’s method based on － 17 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 2 Juche103(2014) preference of interval number when the information of the decision maker on evaluation alternative is stated by interval number [12]. Literature [11] proposed a new method for solution of fuzzy multiple criteria decision making by using S, H and G functions based on fuzzy set theory. In general, there are benefit attributes and cost attributes in multiple-attribute decision- making problems, and the “dimension” of different attributes may be different. Literatures [8] proposed a method that determine the optimal attribute based on which is mapped from D according to the criteria type of satisfactory matrix =Π (μ ) nmij × criteria(the benefit attribute, the cost attribute) The most general method is the arithmetic mean method for integrated decision matrix that add weight to decision matrix given by the decision-makers [13]. Literatures [6, 7] present the group decision making method that decreases the disagreement of decision-makers by fuzzy programming when the required information is given as a supplementary decision matrix. Literature [9] divided decision-making problem into several subproblems when composition of the group decision-makers was very complex and its scale was very large and presented a method that determined the solution of decision-making problem based on the solution of every subproblem. Literature [10] presented an optimization algorithm of the group decision making problem based on fuzzy preference information that is presented as linguistic variable. The shortcomings of preceding methods for fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making are as follows. First, some methods were proposed based on relationship analysis between criteria in fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making problem, but these methods were limited to the case only that the degree of satisfaction of alternative was given as real number, and could not be applied to many practical problems. Second, there are methods for determining criteria weight satisfying required information of decision-makers, but required information of decision-makers are represented by linguistic variable. These methods can not express the requirement of decision-makers more detail. So we present a method for determining the optimal alternative based on relationship analysis between criteria in the group decision-making problem with different forms of preference information of decision-makers on criteria and with the degree of satisfaction represented by the triangle fuzzy number. 1. The Method for Determining the Weights of Criteria 1.1. The type of information expression of decision-makers on criteria weights  In the group decision-making problem, the decision-maker can represent weight information of criteria as one of the following three different expression forms. － 18 － A Method for Determining Alternative of Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Group Decision Making … Type of utility values where ~ u = j ul ( , j um , j uu ) j ~ U }~, nu indicates utility interval of criteria weights jc , at that time ,~,~{ u u 1 2 L = ≤ are infimum, median, supremum of weight of criteria jc . ,1= um uu ul ≤ ≤ ≤ 1 n 0 j j j j ( ), i. e. jul , jum , juu Type of preference relation ~ P = )~( ijp nn × where ~ p = ij ( pl , ij pm ij , pu ij ) indicates the preference degree of the criteria ic over jc and is the required information on ijp that is described by the following formula (5.0 ijpu are infimum, median, supremum of ijp and iw , ww − )1 = + p ij j i , jw are the weight of , where ijpl criteria ic , jc . ijpm , From the definition, the following condition is satisfied , bm bu bu bu bl bl ≤ ≤ = = ≤ ≤ 1 0 ji bm ij bm ij bl ij ij ij ji ≥ ,1 bl = bm ii ii = bu ii ji ij = 5.0 , pl ii = pm ii = pu ii 5.0= ( i , j = ,1 n ) Type of multiplicative preference relation ~ ( ijb = ~ B ) nn × : where ~ b = ij bl ( ij , bm ij , bu ij ) indicates the multiplicative preference degree of the criteria ic over jc and is the required information on ijb that is described by the following formula w i b = ij w ijbu are infimum, median, supremum of ijb , iw , j jw is the weight of , where ijbl criteria ic , jc . ijbm , From the definition, the following condition is satisfied. pl 0 + pm pu pu pu , ≤ ≤ = + + = ≤ ≤ 1 pl ij pm ij pm ij ij ji ij ij ji pl ji 1= , pl = pm ii = pu ii ii 5.0= ( i , j = ,1 n ) Above three expression forms are most general forms that can represent criteria weight information. 1.2. The method for determining weights of criteria In the group decision-making problem, let , , ww , 1 2 L nw be the weight vector of criteria to be determined. If this weight satisfies the requirement of all decision-maker that is represented three forms, the following condition must be satisfied for ,1 n i ul j ≤ w j ≤ uu j j              (1) = , ( w j − um 2) j = em ε≤ j 1 j (2) － 19 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 2 Juche103(2014) pl ij ≤ (5.0 ww − i j pu ij (3) (5.0( ww − )1 −+ j i pm ij em ij ε≤ ij 2 (4) )1 ≤+ 2) = bl ij ≤ ≤ bu ij (5) w i w j 2 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ 3ijε are nonnegative real numbers that is small sufficiently. w i w ε≤ ij bm ij em ij ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ − = 3 j (6) where 1jε , 2ijε , Generally, it is difficult to satisfy all requirements of the decision-makers. Therefore, we must determine the reasonable criteria weight that relax the contradiction of information as much as possible and satisfy requirements of the decision-makers as much as possible. For the multiple-criteria group decision-making problems with t decision-makers under ) provide study, without loss of generality, we suppose that the decision-makers ( ,2,1 = k 1, t L their preference information by means of the utility values, the decision-makers ) provide their preference information by means of the preference relation and ( ) provide their preference information by means of the the decision-makers ( ,1 L+= t 1 k t t t 2 , , ,12 L+ multiplicative preference relation. = k In order to determine the weight vector of criteria, we establish the following linear programming problem.

Then the amount of change is proportional to the deviation values and extends the range And we establish the model again on the basis of changed preference information value and get the deviation values again. If this procedure is repeated until all of the deviation values comes to zero, the final weight values is just the optimal criteria weight vector satisfying the requirement of every decision-makers. 2. A Method for Determining the Optimal Alternative  For fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making problem, we consider a new method for selecting the appropriate alternative among feasible alternative set A in the case where j ) is given by the triangular fuzzy number, decision matrix D is mapping id ( to the matrix of degree of satisfaction and the weights of decision-maker is given as follows: ,1= ,1= , m n i j W J = ( ww , J J 1 2 , ⋅⋅⋅ , w ) , tJ t ∑ w 1 d = J d = 1 Then the matrix of degree of satisfaction of decision-maker dJ ( d ,1= t ) is expressed as follows: ~ d ( ) =Π ) d ( ( μ ij ( x )) nm × = , d ,1= t (8) ) ) d ( μ 11 d ( μ 21 x )( )( x M ) ( d μ m 1 x )( ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ) ) d ( μ 12 ( d μ 22 x )( )( x M ) ( d μ m 2 x )( ⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ O ⋅⋅⋅ ) ) d ( μ n 1 ( d μ n 2 x )( )( x M ) ( d μ mn x )( ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ where ) d ( μ ij x )( = ) d ( ( γβα ij d ( ij ( ij d , , ) ) ) . between criteria exist. There are several criteria for evaluating the alternatives and generally, some relationships If an increase of the degree of satisfaction for one criteria cause to increase the degree of satisfaction for other criteria, then a pair of two criteria is said to be cooperative. If an increase of the degree of satisfaction for one criteria cause to decrease the degree of satisfaction for other criteria, then a pair of two criteria is said to be conflictive. If increase of the degree of satisfaction for one criterion doesn’t cause the variation of the degree of satisfaction, then a pair of two criteria is said to be independent.

This algorithm, first assigns the criterion 1c to 1S , then removes criteria which belongs to 2S and has maximum positive value among the other criteria of 2S , and assign to 1S . So we divide criteria into two classes that cooperate with each other.
