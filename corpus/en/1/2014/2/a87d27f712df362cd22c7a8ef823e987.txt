Key words porous media, infinite cylinder  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Long-term research should be conducted with a view to opening up new scientific fields and introducing the latest developments in science and technology widely in the national economy.” (“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 35 P. 313) In the past, there has been many research works on propagation of sound in a fluid well surrounding with porous media and in a free-end solid bar, while a little of literatures on sound propagation in solid bar surrounding by porous media is available [1－5]. Today, many applications such as logging by solid bar, ultrasonic boring require theoretical studies on sound propagation in solid bar significantly. 1. Wave Equation and Solution in Solid Bar and Porous Media We assume that solid bar is homogenous axisymmetric one, porous media is the isotropic one of which porosity is φ, and that linear dimension of porosity is much smaller than a wavelength. Displacement of wave[1, 2] is u ×∇×∇+∇= ϕ , when it oscillates harmonically, wave ze ψ equation in solid bar may be expressed as 2 ϕϕ pk +∇ 2 2 = 0 (1) = 0 (2) where k 2 p = , c p 2 = 2 μλ + ρ , k s 2 = 2 ω 2 c p and μλ, are Lame’s constants and ρ is the density of bar, ∇ is operator in cylindrical coordinate system, ω is frequency of wave.

Numerical Calculation and Interpretation of Dispersion Equation The dispersion equation is a nonlinear equation of about 70 orders, therefore the analytic solution may be impossible, so we must calculate approximately by computer. We make the numerical calculation using Newton method by MATLAB. In case that radius of bar is m1.0=a , porosity 19.0=φ , viscous coefficient 01.0=η , density of bar =1ρ 1 500 3m/kg , velocity of longitudinal wave 2 s/m450 , velocity of =pc 1 transversal wave in bar =sc 1 1 s/m500 , density of solid 2=ρ 2 650 m/kg , longitudinal 3 velocity 2pc density of porous media =3 670m/s and transversal velocity in porous media 1=fρ 000 3m/kg , velocity in porous fluid 2sc =2 170m/s respectively, 1 500m/s, bulk =3pc modulus of porous solid, we obtained the dispersion curves shown in Fig. Fig. Dispersion curve of velocity according to frequency 1－longitudinal wave, 2－transversal wave The dispersion curves have two forms, where, curves of first form approach from velocity of transversal wave in porous solid to velocity of transversal wave in bar, second forms approach from velocity of longitudinal wave in porous solid to velocity of longitudinal wave in bar. Imaginary parts of velocity of acoustical wave of second form are bigger than those of first form. Therefore a wave of second form does not exist. Transversal reference wave modes in solid bar are corresponding to first form, while longitudinal reference wave modes to second form. Conclusion  In this paper we established the propagation equation of acoustical wave in media with the solid-porous media cylindrical boundary condition and proceeded with a solution. We put the solid-porous media cylindrical boundary condition and leaded the dispersion equation and progressing a numerical calculation of nonlinear equation of 70th order and a interpretation, obtained a phase velocity dispersion curve. － 40 － Propagation of Acoustical Wave in Infinite Cylindrical Solid Bar Surrounded by Porous… References  [1] 종합대학학보(자연과학), 49, 3, 12, 주체92(2003).
