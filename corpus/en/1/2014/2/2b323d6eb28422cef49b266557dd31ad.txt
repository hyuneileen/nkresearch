Key words organophosphorous growth regulator, di-(β-chloroethyl)-α-hydroxyethyl phosphonate, growth, yield  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “The chemical industry should produce larger quantities of different kinds of agricultural chemicals such as highly effective weed killer and insecticide, growth stimulant and growth restraint.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 33 P. 29) Application of plant growth regulators is significant to acceleration of crop growth and to increase in crop yield [2－5]. Recently there are many studies on plant growth regulators in our country [1]. We investigated the effects of organic phosphorous compound di-(β-chloroethyl)-α- hydroxyethyl phosphonate(DCHP), a new synthetic substance in our country, on growth and yield of crops. 1. Materials and Methods 1.1. Materials Experimental crops were rice(var. “Pyongyang No. 50”), maize (var. “Chongun No. 3”), bean(var. “Sunchon No. 3”), cabbage(var. “cabbage No. 55”) and radish(var. “second crop No. 4”). 1.2. Methods Germination rates of rice, maize and bean were measured 8 days and their germination powers were measured 4 days after soaking seeds in DCHP solution [2]. Germination powers were measured 3 days later, and germination rates of cabbage and radish were measured 6 days later [2]. For rice crop, leaf sprays were arranged for two occasions in seedling bed and at intervals of ten days two occasions after earing in paddy the yield was investigated. － 111 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 2 Juche103(2014) For vegetable crops, leaf sprays were arranged for four occasions in field and the yield was investigated. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Effect of organic phosphorous regulator on germination of crops First, we investigated the effect of organic phosphorous regulator (DCHP) on germination of rice, maize and bean, the result is as following (table 1). Table 1.

Next, we investigated effect of DCHP on germination of cabbage (table 2). Table 2.

In particular, cabbage population treated with 1 000 000 times DS for 2 hours showed germination rate of 99%, germination power of 76.3%, and average shoot length of 2.01mm which are 9.9, 11.8 and 22.6% higher, respectively, than control population. This means 1 000 000 times DCHP-treatment of 2h is the most suitable to cabbage crop. Changes in activities of some enzymes were analyzed to identify the mechanism for － 112 － Effects of Di-(β-chloroethyl)-α-hydroxyethyl Phosphonate on Growth … DCHP acceleration of rice seed germination (table 3). Table 3. Effect of DCHP on activities of enzymes in rice seed Treatment Catalase activity /(μmol·g－1·h－1) 6.75±0.54 9.12±0.78 2.37 Concentration: 100 000 times DS, soaking duration: 30h, measurement: after germination Peroxidase activity /(mg·g－1·h－1) 1.61±0.12 1.98±0.10 0.37 Amylase activity /(mg·g－1·h－1) 2.13±0.12 2.55±0.17 0.42 Control Test Difference As shown in the table 3, DCHP treatment of rice seed increased activity of catalase to 125.1%, activity of peroxydase to 122.9% and activity of amylase to 119.9% in contrast with control. Activities of amylase and catalase were measured to identify biochemical mechanism of accelerating germination in cabbage and radish seeds treated with DCHP (table 4). Table 4.

It shows that DCHP treatment for seeds of Brassicaceae accelerates germination by increasing activities of hydrolases and oxydoreductases. Nucleic acid content was measured in rice and maize after seed treatment of DCHP (table 5). Table 5.

Generally, DNA content of plant doesn’t differ because it is a hereditary character of its plant, but m-RNA content differs according to seed vitality. － 113 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 2 Juche103(2014) It shows that total nucleic acid content increases 0.45～1.45μg/L in rice, 0.2～2.15μg/L in maize more than control. This means that germination rate and germination power are increased because the synthesis of m-RNA coding transcription of hydrolases and oxydoreductases is enhanced. 2.2. Effect of DCHP leaf spray on growth of vegetable crops Firstly, we investigated the effect of DCHP leaf spray on growth of cabbage, the result is as following (table 6). Table 6.

Especially, in case of the regulator 3 ～ 4 times witht 1 000 000 folds DS, the best effects appeared. Next, effect of DCHP leaf spray on growth of radish was investigated (table 7). Table 7. Effect of DCHP leaf spray on growth of radish Division Control Leaf growth Root growth Number of leaves 13.1 Length of leaf / cm 20.6 Number of roots 13.5 Diameter of root / cm 5.2 Total weight /(g·plant－1) 2 times 3 times 4 times 2 times 3 times 4 times 2 times 3 times 4 times 100 000 1 000 000 10 000 000 15.0 15.3 15.7 14.7 17.4 18.1 14.9 16.1 16.4 14.9 15.2 16.7 14.6 16.8 17.2 14.4 16.2 16.6 21.4 22.1 23.0 21.7 24.9 25.3 20.7 23.6 23.9 － 114 － 6.0 6.3 6.5 5.9 7.0 6.8 5.7 6.5 6.8 542.7 579.0 581.5 590.1 573.4 694.1 703.6 570.1 621.9 623.2 Effects of Di-(β-chloroethyl)-α-hydroxyethyl Phosphonate on Growth … As shown in table 7, the tendency was very similar to that of cabbage crop in radish crop. It shows that leaf spray 3～4 times with 1 000 000 folds DS is optimal for acceleration of vegetative growth. 2.3. Effect of DCHP on the yield of crops Firstly, effect of DCHP on the yield of rice was found (table 8). Table 8. Effect of DCHP on yield of rice Index Group Number of ear per m2 Number of grain per ear Maturity / % 1 000 grain weight/g Control Test 245 247 * LSD0.01 = 430kg/ha 117 121 80.3 82.9 29.0 29.4 Yield /(t·ha－1) 6.68 7.28 Difference /(kg·ha－1) － 600 Rate /% 100 108.9 As shown in table 8, the yield components were increased number of ear by 2 per m2, number of grain by 4 per ear, maturity by 2.6%. yeild per ha 7.28t, by 8.9% higher than control. It shows that DCHP has a positive effect on yield of rice. Next, effect of DCHP on yield of radish was investigated.(table 9) Table 9. Effect of DCHP on yield of radish Weight per plant / kg 0.62 0.77 Yield per m2/kg 4.8 6.0 Yield /(t·ha－1) 48 60 Difference /(t·ha－1) － 12* Rate / % 100 124.5 Group Control Test * LSD0.01 =5.6t/ha Table 9 shows that weight of a radish is increased 150g; yield of radish is increased 12t per ha higher than control. Last, we found the effect of DCHP on yield of cabbage.(table 10) Table 10. Effect of DCHP on yield of cabbage Index Diameter /cm Weight per plant /kg 17.2 20.0 2.12 2.78 Yield /(t·ha－1) 95.4 125.1 Difference /(t·ha－1) - 29.7＊ Rate / % 100 131.1 Group Control Test Height /cm 41.7 44.4 * LSD0.01 =6.5t/ha As shown in table 10, in case of DCHP leaf spray-treatment 4 times with 1 000 000 folds DS, yield increased 31.1% more than control. Above results mean that DCHP newly synthesized in our country is a good organic phosphorous growth regulator which contribute to increasing crop and vegetable yields with lowest concentration. － 115 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 2 Juche103(2014) Conclusion  1) The seed treatment of rice, maize, bean, cabbage and radish by 100 000 to 1 000 000 times DS of di-(β-chloroethyl)-α-hydroxyethyl phosphonate(DCHP) increases activities of hydrolases and oxydoreductases and germination power to 7.6～20% 2) The leaf spray with 100 000 times DS for grain crop and 1 000 000 times DS for vegetable accelerates their growth, and increases the yield of grain to 108～116%, vegetable to 118～133%.
