Recently, it was reported that quercetin-Zn complex had significant antitumor activity and anti-inflammation activity[1]. We proceeded basic studies to elucidate molecular mechanism of medical activity by − scavenging characteristics. So far, it was been reported that quercetin-Zn . investigating its 2O − scavenging characteristics − scavenging activity[1], but data elucidating its . . 2O 2O complex had in detail have rarely been described. 1. Method and Materials Material All reagents and solvents were analytical reagent grade. Vit B2(riboflavin), EDTA(ethylene diamin tetra acetic acid), NBT(nitro blue tetrazolium) were purchased from “Sigma”. Method Purity of quercetin was (96±2)%. The quercetin-Zn complex was prepared by modifying previous method[1]. In a 150cm3 three-necked, round-bottomed flask provided with an electromagnetic stirrer, reflux condenser and CaCl2-guard tube were placed quercetin·2H2O(0.3mmol) and absolute EtOH(25cm3). Then the flask was heated to 60℃ on a water-bath. When the solid quercetin·2H2O dissolved, sodium carbonate(0.6mmol) was added quickly, and the solution was stirred and heated to reflux. After 1h, the zinc acetate(0.6mmol) was added and the solution － 77 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 2 Juche103(2014) was stirred and heated to reflux for 6h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into H2O(250cm3). The pale yellow precipitate which was formed immediately, was set aside for 48h, then centrifuged by using a high speed cooling centrifugal separator, washed thrice with 1：3 EtOH-H2O, then several times with H2O to free the precipitant from metal ion. The solid product was dried in vacuum for 48h. The yield was 72～85%. Water contents of quercetin and quercetin-Zn complex are 10.72 and 6.43%, coinciding with two and three water molecules, respectively. We used high speed cooling centrifugal separator “KUBOTA KR-20000S” and photoelectric photometer “HIRAMA PHOTOMETER MODEL 4C”. Quercetin-Zn complex has been characterized by IR, UV and atomic extinction analysis. − scavenging activity was measured according to the modified NBT method[2].

The reaction − . 2O mixture of 3mL contained 8μmol/L Vit B2, 667 μmol/L EDTA, 50 μmol/L NBT, 0.035mol/L NaH2PO4–NaOH buffer(pH 7.5) and 6 ～ 120 μmol/L tested compound. The reaction was carried out under the fluorescent lighting for 5min at room temperature. The amount of reduced NBT was detected by the absorbance at 560nm, since the reduced product, blue − was calculated from . formazan, absorbs at this wavelength. The scavenging ratio(%) for 2O the following expression. Scavenging ratio= ( A 0 − AA /) 0 ⋅ 100 where A is the absorbance in the presence of quercetin or its Zn-complex, A0 is the absorbance in the absence of quercetin or its Zn- complex. 2.
