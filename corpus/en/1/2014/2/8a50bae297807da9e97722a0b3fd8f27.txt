Key words neutron source, radio-activation method, threshold detector  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “Now is the age of science and technology, which is the basis of economic progress.” (“KIM JONG IL SELECTED WORKS” Vol. 10 P. 22) Accelerator neutron source, which bombards a tritium target with the deuterium ion beam to get neutron, strictly speaking, cannot be a spherical source, thus the correct determination of the angle distribution character of neutron beam in finite sources except for a dot source is very important in estimating the intensity character of the accelerator neutron source. Reaction (n, n2 ), inelastic reaction and several reactions of (n, p), (n, α)are taken place only when the neutron energy exceeds a definite one. In many cases the products of such reactions are radioactive nuclei, and we can determine the flux and energy spectrum of neutron by measuring the radioactivity. Thus a material activated only by neutron over a definite energy is called threshold detector. In general, a various detectors and measuring methods are applied to detect the neutron[2 －5]. The reaction (n, 2n) is used to measure the energy and flux of neutron in the range of 9 MeV. Now the threshold detectors of using LiF or 63Cu(n, 2n)62Cu[1] are numerous, but there is no instance of using fluorine resin. 1. Measurement of the Neutron Strength by the Fluorine Radio-Activation Method in 3 )n,d(T He Reaction 4 As a detector sample for the measurement of neutron beam, we chose fluorine resin, which has threshold energy of 10.8MeV for (n, 2n) reaction. In general, the influence of coexistence element is very important in radio-activation method, which raises an optimization problem. Fluorine resin can have any size, any weight and any shape. And fluorine has only one isotope in nature and the product nucleus to be measured has a long half-life, which are quite － 52 － Measurement of the Intensity and Spectra of the Neutron from Reaction )n,d(T He by Low… 3 4 suitable for the measurement of induction radioactivity. Carbon in fluorine resin also reacts with fast neutron but has no sensitivity to the generated 14MeV neutron because its threshold energy is 20.8MeV high. The half-life of the nuclides produced from other reactions exception for reaction (n, 2n) by fluorine and 14 MeV neutron is about several tens of second, thus a reasonable selection of rest time can minimize the influence on product nucleus with the short half-life. The fluorine resin sample used in experiment has a disc type of 6mm in thickness and 20mm in diameter and its mass is 3.806g. The voltage and current was set to 150kV and 400 Aμ respectively to measure neutron beam and the samples were placed at the points 15cm away from target. We chose the four points and performed measurements.

We determined a function of neutron beam according to angle θ, )(θΦ with four points. In a sphere coordinates, it can be said that the neutron beam is constant according to angle ϕ and is changed continuously only by angle θ, so that )(θΦ can be written.

The reactivity of target T3 was Ti 3− had a diameter of 40mm. T The fast neutron sensor was installed at the point 10cm away from the target located at center and the spectra were measured at the angles, 0°, 45° and 90° with an incident direction angle as a standard angle 0°( Fig. 1－4). 105.5 ⋅ Bq 11 Fig. 1.

Figures show that the 14MeV monochrome neutron was obtained at the angle , which are different little by little  according to angle. Our results are coincident with reference [3]. o90=θ Conclusion  F19 exists in nature state and its coexistence element has no effect on measurement.
