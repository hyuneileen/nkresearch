Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 2 Juche103(2014) The Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions for Infinite Horizon Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with Poission Jumps Sin Myong Guk, Mun Chol Abstract The properties of the infinite horizon forward-backward stochastic differential equation with jumps (JFBSDE) are investigated. First of all, we proved the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the infinite horizon backward stochastic differential equation with jumps(JBSDE). And under monotonicity conditions, the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the forward-backward stochastic differential equation with jumps are proved. Key word infinite horizon forward-backward stochastic differential equation, Poission jump  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “Today scientists and technicians are faced with a very important task. They must forge ahead more energetically with scientific research work in order to make a great contribution to raising the scientific and technological level of the country to a higher stage and developing the national economy at a rapid pace.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 37 P. 359) The forward stochastic differential equations and the backward stochastic differential equations are mainly considered before respectively. However, in setting the stochastic controlled problem with the random coefficient and studying its solutions, it was mentioned in many works that combining and considering the two kinds of equations were reasonable and important ways. With the study of stochastic control theory, the backward stochastic differential equation was established, and it had many adapted fields intensifying the studies. ), tz ))( tytg ( they dwtz )( , t It was firstly suggested and investigated by [7].

The forward-backward stochastic differential equation which had continuous and discontinuous perturbation was investigated; however, it was the special case that the solution of the backward stochastic differential equation was independent to forward stochastic differential equation. In [6] discussed the existence and uniqueness of solution for finite horizon BSDE and FBSDE with jumps. In this paper, we set the infinite horizon forward-backward stochastic differential equation with jumps and proved the existence and uniqueness of its solution. 1.
