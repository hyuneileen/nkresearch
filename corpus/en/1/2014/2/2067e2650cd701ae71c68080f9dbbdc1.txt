And we obtained detail calculations on the displacements, deformations, stress fields, reflection and interference effects in propagation of the plane P-SV wave, and compared with results in the FEM. Key words Wavelet-Galerkin method, plane P-SV wave, basis function Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “The fundamental question in scientific research is to keep developing science and technology in the direction required by our Party and our revolution, holding fast to the Juche stand.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 21 P. 450) In the literature [4] was considered the analytical method used the variable separating and Furier method which are common integration means of the partial differential equation. In the [6, 7] common analytical method on the simplest one dimensional wave problem is considered with several fundamental problems in the applying the wave phenomenon of the wavelet approximate theory. In the [5] was introduced approximate solution method of the one dimensional wave equation used wavelet method. Here, unknown displacement is represented as variable separation on the time and coordinates and Daubeches wavelet scaling function is used as basis function, and multistep calculation diagram is made by direct substituting displacement representation to wave equation. In the [1, 2] was considered free vibration analysis of the elastic cable by Wavelet- Galerkin method. In this paper we have introduced a method of expression of the motion equation at the yards of displacement and speed of displacement and fundamental equation of the Wavelet- Galerkin method, and determined basis functions satisfying boundary condition at the free boundary. And on the basis of analysis algorithm numerical calculation on the displacement, deformation, stress field and reflection, interference effect in propagation of the plane P-SV wave is preceded, and validity through comparison analysis with results of finite element method is demonstrated. － 11 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 2 Juche103(2014) 1.

Analysis model － 14 － The Propagation of the Plane Elastic Wave by Wavelet-Galerkin Method In this calculations we treat the cases of action of the wave sources 1s and 2s . When only wave source 1s exists, the longitudinal wave produced from a wave source = arrives the recovers R with velocity of )s/km(15.3 /2 + ρμλ after .1=t s122 . In this calculation, we have checked the vibration amplitude (greatest defection of particle . Fig. 2 represents the analysis results from equilibrium position) from .1=t of thesis’s method and finite element method(ANSIS) and relative error is about 21%(number of element are 16 384 in the both of WGM and FEM). .1=t to s122 s116 Fig. 3 shows the case in which only wave source 1s exists and the case in which both 1s and 2s exist. Fig. 2. Comparison curve when one wave source exists 1－WEM, 2－FEM Fig. 3. Comparison of vibration curve at receive point R 1－Case that one wave source exists, 2－Case that two waves source exist In this case amplitude of displacement increases in the place where both of compression regions and of rarity regions overlap each other, but decreases where compression region and rarity region overlap in the medium. When singular loads exist in both wave sources simultaneously, relative error of displacement values of x-direction determined by WGM with FEM in local time interval is 17% at maximum displacement point. ～=t 08.0 ( )s24.0 As seen above, the thesis’s method strongly displayed the local change characteristics in the near of maximum, minimum points than the FEM. Conclusion We suggested a method of expressing motion equation of the plane P-SV elastic wave in displacement-displacement velocity field and derived main relation of wavelet-Galerkin method and determined basis function satisfying free boundary conditions. From the computation results according to settled models when the loading having strong change characteristics and slow change characteristics, results of thesis’s method and FEM have relative error of average 11.5, 4.15% according to two wave type respectively. － 15 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 2 Juche103(2014) References  [1] M.
