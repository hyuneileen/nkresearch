Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 3 No. 2 Juche103(2014) Separation and Refinement of Tc in the Sulfuric Acid Leachate after the Denitration of the Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Solution Pak Hwa Chol Abstract We have separated fissile elements and Tc, Mo, and Ru, by denitrating the fuel reprocessing solution, leaching by sulfuric acid and extracting the leachate with tri-n- octylamine(TOA). We have prepared the final product, NH4TcO4, removing the molybdenium by the reextraction of the back extract with the di-2-ethylhexylphosphate(HEDHP) and removing the ruthenium by the distillation. Key words Tc, nuclear fuel reprocessing solution, radiopharmaceuticals  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said as follows. “We must open new fields of science, introduce the latest achievements of science and technology throughout the national economy, and actively develop the important areas of the basic sciences.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 15 P. 197) The reactions between the coordination compounds of 99mTc and the various polyaminocarboxylic acid(PACA) have been investigating widely worldwide because they occupy more than 85% of  radiopharmaceuticals [2－5]. 99Tc which uses in the basic researches of such radiopharmaceuticals are taken from the nuclear fuel reprocessing solution. We have already found that the tiny amount of fissile elements including Tc, Ru, Mo exist when the fuel reprocessing solution is denitrated and then the precipitate is leached by sulfuric acid [1]. In this paper we described the preparation of final product, NH4TcO4, removing the tiny amount of fissile elements by the extraction of this leachate by the tri-n-octylamine(TOA), removing the molybdenum by reextraction of the back extract with the di-2- ethylhexylamine(HEDHP), and removing the ruthenium by the distillation [6－8]. 1. Experimental Method 1.1. Analytical method of element  Tc and Pd were measured with the γ ray liquid scintillator of type “FJ-353” by labeling 99mTc and 102Pd separately, and Zr, Ce, Fe, Sb and Re were measured with the β-ray automatic discharge counter of type “FH-408” by labelling 95Zr–95Nb, 144Ce–144Pr, 59Fe, 124Sb and 188Re separately. － 47 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 2 Juche103(2014) Mo and Rh were analyzed with the specific flame atomic extinction method. In the case , the ashing of Mo, the wavelength is 313nm, the basic transformer is MgNO g5 μ g3 μ Pd + 3 temperature is 1 500℃ and the temperature of atomization is 2 400℃. In the case of Rh, the wavelength is 343nm, the basic transformer is not used, the ashing temperature is 900℃ and the temperature of atomization is 2 200℃. 1.2. Removing trace fission elements from the sulfuric acid leachate by TOA The extractant is the mixture of 10% TOA/10% n-hexanol/80% kerosene (v/v/v). The sulfurric acid leachate was extracted for 5 min by the same volume of the extractant and then the organic phase was washed with the same volume of 0.1 mol/L HNO3. The separated effect was determined by the tracer method and the specific flame atomic extinction method.

Removing Mo by HEDHF The extractant is the mixture of 20% HEDHF / 80% kerosene(v/v). The back extractant of TOA was extracted for 5min by the same volume of the extractant. The separated effect was determined with above mentioned method. 1.4. Removing Ru by the distillation The solution was distilled at 100℃ for the content of Ru to find the effect on the loss of Tc during the distillation of Ru, the chlorine gas flowing through the distiller. After the distillation the removing coefficient of Ru and the loss(%) of Tc were calculated by measuring the specific radio activities of 103Ru and 99mTc in the solution The removing coefficien Ru of t = The original  specific  radioactiv The = specific  radioactiv ity ity  distillati  after on The loss  Tc of The = = original  specific  radioactiv The ity original The − specific specific radio radioactiv activity ity after distillati on ⋅ 100 2.

Most of Tc and Mo and some of Ru were extracted at the H+ ion concentration from 0.1 to 1 mol/L and the other fissile elements were removed. The mechanism of the extraction and the stripping can be represented as follows [9]. +           (1) NHTcO TcO [R → + ] 3 4 NR 3 After the loading organic phase was stripped by NaOH solution of 2mol/L at A/O ratio (2) NHTcO OH 2 TcO OH [R → + + + ] 4 3 − 4 − 4 NHR 3 − of 1/3, Ru and Mo in organic phase did not appeare. This showed that Mo and Ru had been stripped into the aqueous phase with Tc completely. 2.2. Removing Mo by HEDHF The important impurities in the stripping solution were Ru and Mo.

And the trace fissile elements also were extracted. The extraction of Mo(VI) in HNO3 takes place with the additive coordination combination and the ionic coordination combination [10]. = + + 2 4 MoO 2 + 4 MoO 2 )HAm( − 3 + + 2NO (2mAMoO 2 2 − m)HA + 2H + (3) )HAm( = MoO (NO ) 23 2 2 ⋅ 2mHA (4) where HA is the HEDHP. Tc was not extracted because of the existence of − 4TcO . The UV–Vis spectra of MoO4 2- in HNO3 were shown in Fig. － 49 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 2 Juche103(2014) Fig. UV–Vis spectra of MoO4 2- in various concentration of HNO3 a) neutral media (1－[HNO3]=0.01mol/L), b) acid media of 0.5(2), 1.0(3) and 2.0(4)mol/L HNO3, c) acid media of 3.0(5), 4.0(6), 6.0(7) and 10(8)mol/L HNO3 Fig. shows that Mo(VI) exists as MoO4 2- in neutral media, that the absorption peak appears on the wavelength of 206nm at the No.1, that if the acidity of media increase it appears on the wavelength of 250, 255, 259nm at the No. 2, 3 and 4, respectively and that when the concentration of HNO3 is 2mol/L it appears on the wavelength of 328nm at the No. 4MoO in neutral media, forms 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively. This shows that Mo, existing as 4MoO when the acidity increases and forms the 4MoO when the concentration of HNO3 the polyvalent acid by the condensation of −2 4MoO of bioxidation-coordination compound −2 −2 −2 reaches more than 2mol/L [9－12]. 2.3.

Ru exists as RuO4, which is volatile compound, but Tc(VII) is not distilled in alkali media. There could be the tiny amount of different salts including Tc in the solution after the distillation. So we allowed the H+ ionic concentration of the solution to be 0.1 － 0.5 mol/L with HNO3 and extracted the aqueous solution three times with TOA having one-third of this concentration to remove that salts and increase the purity of Tc, and then prepared NH4TcO4 by back extracting the loaded organic phase with the NH3·H2O of 1mol/L. － 50 － Separation and Refinement of Tc in the Sulfuric Acid Leachate after the Denitration … Conclusion  When the sulfuric acid leachate is extracted with TOA at the H+ ionic concentration from 0.1 to 1mol/L, Tc is extracted more than 98% and Mo and Ru also are extracted together. When that stripping is extracted with HEDHP at the concentration of H+ ion over 2 mol/L, Mo is extracted and removed and when the effluent is distilled, Ru is removed.
