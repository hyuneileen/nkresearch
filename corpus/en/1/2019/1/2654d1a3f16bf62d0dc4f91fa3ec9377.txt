A Method to Decide Diffusion Coefficient of Heavy Metals in Soil Choe Tong Hyok Faculty of Global Environmental Science, Kim Il Sung University The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “Another important matter in land management is to do everything possible to improve the soil.” It is important to decide the diffusion coefficient correctly to diagnose and predict about the diffusion of heavy metals correctly in soil. There was a study to decide separately diffusion coefficient and solutions of prediction equations. [1-3] This paper it was discussed about a method to decide diffusion coefficient of heavy metals in soil. 1. Convection diffusion equation of heavy metals in soil In soil a diffusion equation of heavy metals are as follows. [1] Initial condition Boundary condition (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Where is a concentration of j ion in soil solution (mg/100g), is a concentration of j ion in soil absorbing complex(mg/100g), is a selectivity coefficient of ion exchange, is a diffusion coefficient (m2/d), m is a sponginess － 44 － of soil, is a moisture of soil, is a saturated humidity of soil, u is a vertical travelling speed of soil moisture (m/d), t is a time scale (d) and z is a depth of soil (m). First, let‟s convert all variables in Eq. (1)－(6) into dimensionless quantities. Where , and are characteristic coefficients and cпj is a concentration of j ion in the irrigation water or rainwater (mg/100g). Then, the Eq. (1)－(7) are converted as follows. (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) where the initial and boundary condition are converted as follows. Initial condition boundary condition － 45 － (14) Where are dimensionless concentrations of j ion in soil moisture and absorbing complex. The mass flow is zero at z=0. then 2. Deciding the diffusion coefficient Let‟s convert Eq. (15) by Eq. (7) into dimensionless quantity, then Let‟s convert into a difference schema and arrange in order by , then (15) (16) (17) One can predict using Eq. (17) and Eq. (7)―(14). At s+1-time step, an initial approximation of the are as follows. At three points in the research area, measured value, predicted value and error of the lead and cadmium are as follows. Table 1.

Therefore, this method can be used for the diffusion prediction of the heavy metals in soil.
