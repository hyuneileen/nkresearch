The existence and uniqueness of the solution for the integral boundary value problem was studied in [1] by Schauder‟s ﬁxed-point theorem and Banach‟s ﬁxed point theorem in ordered Banach spaces, and in [2], they studied the existence of the solution for the boundary value problem with fractional integral boundary conditions. In [3] they investigated the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the nonlinear fractional integro-diﬀerential equation with integral boundary conditions and in [4] the existence of the solution for the system of fractional differential equations with nonlocal integral boundary conditions was studied. Also, in [5], they discussed the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the fractional differential equation with integral boundary conditions, and the existence and uniqueness of the solution for single term fractional differential equations with various kinds of integral boundary conditions was dealt in [6-8]. In this paper we study the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the integral boundary value problem of multi term nonlinear fractional differential equations in which  and , the order of the derivative in the nonlinear term , is extended to boundary conditions are more generalized than those in [1-8]. Our integral boundary value problem is as follows: (1) － 52 － (2) (3) where and Remark 1.It was supposed in [1] that or . They excluded the case of . But we discuss this case too.
