3D Multicycle Core Burnup Calculation of 1000MWe PWR Ho Il Mun, So Chol, Ri Hye Ryon Faculty of Energy Science, Kim Il Sung University The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said as follows. “Along with this any scientific and technological problems relating to the construction of hydroelectric- and thermal-power stations and atomic power plants that are suited to the conditions in our country should be solved.” (“ON THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY” p.2） In nuclear power reactors, the core undergoes several transient cycles from the initial fuel loading to the equilibrium cycle, so multicycle burnup analysis for the core is necessary. We have performed 3D multicycle burnup calculation for the core of 1 000MWe class PWR by using the PWR physics calculation system “BuHung” [1-3]. 1. Core Configuration of 1 000MWe class PWR The core of 1000MWe class PWR consists of 177 of fuel assemblies.

Calculation Results We have performed 3D burnup calculations on the above mentioned four cycles. For the first cycle, the multiplication factors of the core consisting of nine types of assembies at the several operating states have been calculated in the beginning of the cycle (BOC) as shown in Table 2.

Comparison of assembly power distribution of fuel assemblies at the end of first cycle(cycle burnup13.75GW·d/tU, critical boron concentration 1.19·10-3%) － 62 － Average power distribution of assemblies at the beginning and the end of the first cycle in the heat full power state are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. In two cases, maximum deviations in the power distribution are 3.23% and 5.45%, respectively. The cycle length corresponding to the cycle burnup 13.75GW·d/tU is 371 days, which is only 3 days longer than 368 days (cycle burnup 13.65GW·d/tU) of reference [4]. Fig. 4. Power distribution of fuel assemblies at the end of second cycle Fig. 5. Power distribution of fuel assemblies at the end of third cycle According to the fuel reloading patterns shown in Fig.1, burnup calculations for 2 to 4 － 63 － cycles were performed. Average power distributions of assemblies at the end of second and third cycles are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. Maximum deviations are 7.84% and 7.05%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5. These results describe that the calculations were performed with the full accuracies. Critical boron concentration changes according to burnup in each cycle are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6. Critical boron concentration changes according to burnup in each cycle Fig. 7.  Moderator temperature coefficient changes according to burnup in each cycle As for the first cycle, after xenon concentration builds up to the equilibrium value, the critical boron concentration has increased somewhat because of the burning of Gd, and then decreased slowly with the increasing of burnup. The critical boron concentration has decreased almost linearly with the consuming of Gd. In the other cycles, critical boron concentrations have decreased almost linearly from the beginning. In general, if the types of fresh fuel assemblies loaded into the core in every cycle are same, the equilibrium cycle is achieved after 3 and 4 － 64 － cycles. However, in these calculations, because the fresh assembly types are different in each cycle, the result curves are not confirmed. Moderator temperature coefficient changes according to burnup have the similar tendency with the changes of critical boron concenstration (Fig. 7). It is because the temperature coefficient is closely related to the boron concentration in the moderator (coolant). The higher the boron concentration in the moderator is, the lower the absolute value of the temperature coefficient of moderator is. The temperature of moderator is positive even above a limit boron concentration.[5] The critical boron concentration for the compensation of the excess reactivity is decreased with the burnup progress; therefore, the absolute value of the moderator temperature coefficient is also increased accordingly. The burnup step was choosen as 250MW·d/tU in these calculations. The calculation time from 1 to 4 cycles is 3 287s when used a PC with a 3.4GHz Intel Core i3. By using the PWR physics calculation system “BuHung” with capabilities of 3D burnup analysis, thermal hydraulic feedback and criticality search, we performed 3D core burnup calculation for 1 to 4 cycles of 1000MWe class PWR. The calculation results were all in good agreement with those of the reference. ［1］Journal of Kim Il Sung University(natural science), 53, 6, 81, Juche 96(2007). ［2］Journal of Kim Il Sung University(natural science), 57, 7, 65, Juche 100(2011). ［3］Journal of Kim Il Sung University(natural science), 57, 2, 71, Juche 100(2011). ［4］System 80+(Trademark) Standard Cessar Design Certification, Amendment 1,1990, Vol.4. ［5］谢仲生, 压水堆核电厂堆芯燃料管理计算及伏化, 原子能出版社, 86-104, 2001.
