Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 4 No. 1 Juche104(2015) Electron Density Distribution of Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 Kim Yong Hwan, Kim Kyong Su and Han Sang Sol Abstract The synthesis method of Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 and the electron density distribution from precise XRD data have been studied. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the electron density distribution in Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 has been made using the maximum entropy method(MEM). Key words MEM, Tl-system superconductor  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said. “Scientists and technicians should work to overcome by their own efforts the problems which require an urgent solution for the development of the national economy of our country, and to introduce the scientific and technical successes of developed countries in accordance with its specific reality.”(“KIM JONG IL SELECTED WORKS” Vol. 10 P. 195～196) In this paper we have considered the synthesis and the electron density distribution of Tl-system superconductor high-Tc phase(Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10). The position of atoms is clearly shown and this is closely with SEM for Tl-system high superconductor. And electron density distribution of coaxial circle is shown in the position of Ca atom. It is because of substitution effect of Tl and Ca. 1. Theoretical Consideration The electronic structure of many material has been studied by many researchers[7－10], and these studies have provided enhanced knowledge about the bonding in these materials. Recently, the maximum entropy method(MEM) has provided a thrust in the calculation of electron density distribution as this method is proved to be unbiased and more accurate when compared with the conventional Fourier synthesis. MEM does not suffer seriously from termination errors and the requirement of the structural model to be very nearly the same as the true one is not needed. The probabilistic approach was formulated by Colins [11] to analyze the structure factor in order to Calculate the electron density at the ith pixel by increasing the entropy iteratively, where the entropy is defined as S −= ∑ i are normalized electron densities of the present and previous iteration i i ′ ( ρ r ) ln[ ′ ( ρ r /) ′ ρ 0 ( r )] where ( irρ′ ) and irρ′ (0 ) cycles, and are defined as, － 54 － Electron Density Distribution of Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 ′ ( ρ r i ) = ( ρ r i ) ′ ρ 0 ( r i ) = ρ 0 r )( i ρ 0 r .)( i r )( i ∑ ρ ∑ A weak constraint is introduced as  ∑ ∑ which is expected to be unity under minimum iterations. Here k )( /1( obs N C )] cal F F = − k [ ) ( 2 2 σ  )( k FN , obs ( Fk ), cal k )( and )(kσ are the number of available reflections, observed and calculated structure factors and standard deviations of the observations respectively.

The Synthesis of Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 Superconductor The synthesis of Tl-system superconductor and the effects of sintering conditions on its formation has been studied by many researchers [1－7]. The starting materials except Tl2O3 with a composition of Ba：Ca：Cu=2：2：3 were prepared by mixing and grinding BaCO3(purity 99.9%), CaCO3(purity 99.9%), CuO(purity 99.9%). Then the starting materials were pressed and sintered at 890℃ several times, thus obtained Ba-Ca-Cu oxide. And the starting materials with a composition of Tl：Ba：Ca：Cu=2：2：2：3 were prepared by mixing and grinding Ba-Ca-Cu oxide and Tl2O3, obtained the sample 10mm in diameter,      1～2mm in thickness by pressing (1.5～2)·108Pa. This was put on Al2O3 plate and kept in a pipe of stainless steel, and sintered in oxygen of 2L/min at 880℃ for 5～10min. temperature. The T-onset of the sample was 110K, it’s critical electric current was 3·107A/m2 in liquid nitrogen Measurement condition is as follows. X-ray tube: target-Cu, voltage－35kV, current－20mA, scanning: scan mode－CONTI, scan speed － 2.000deg/min, full scale － 2.0kcps, Data processing condition: smoothing points － 7, background subtraction－YES, separation－YES.
