Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 4 No. 1 Juche104(2015) The Development of Spicular and Floating Characteristics of the Insect Eggs of the Trichocephalus ovis Parasitic to Goat Chae Je Man, Choe Ryong Il, Jang Sun Bom and Chon Ho Yong Abstract The development of spicular of the Trichocephalus ovis parasitic to the goats and the changing process of its form in degrade was clarified and the specific gravity of the insect eggs in the various developmental stages was investigated to the float method by sugar solution. According to research result, spicular of Trichocephalus ovis parasitic to the goats was developed within 95 days and the specific gravity of mature insect egg was 1.23. Key words goat, parasite, insect egg  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said. “The veterinary and epizootic prevention work should be strengthened. Only by so doing can we prevent epizootics and various other diseases or death of domestic animals and steadily increase animal products.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 8 P. 393) Whipworm is spread all over the world including our country where goats are bred. It is not a cause of acute epidemic but gives negative effect to husbandry such as diarrhea and growth delay. In addition, it is the main factor of pasture pollution by soil infection. In our country, some characters about whipworm parasitic to goats are discovered, but its floating property was not found. Therefore, checking and diagnosis of animal are in difficulty. The forms of spicular of T. ovis are important in type decision of Trichuris. In literature the forms of spicular are glass-shaped [1, 2, 4－6, 9], triangled [3], or round shape [10]. So it is difficult for vets to decide species of parasite. Also according to existing theory the diagnosis of Trichuris trichira was done by float method with saturated salt water [1, 2, 4－8], but in fact in the specific gravity of 1.2 there was no float, so wrong diagnosis was made occasionally. Therefore, we surveyed specific gravity of insect eggs in difference development stages and found out the development process of T. ovis. 1. Materials and Methods 1.1. Place and period Experiments were proceeded in a laboratory animal shed of Pyongyang Agricultural College of Kim Il Sung University and goat farms from April 2008 to September 2014. － 108 － The Development of Spicular and Floating Characteristics of the Insect Eggs of … 1.2. Materials In the experiments1 500 goats were used as Laboratory animals. Gravimeter, scale, microscope “(ML-4M)”, thermometer, beaker, and so on. Sugar powder and salt as reagents. 1.3. Methods We held postmortem of 20 goats infected by whipworm to investigate parasitism parts and Investigation of spicular development characteristics of T. ovis parasitic to goats was done as First, we transmitted infiltrative eggs to uninfected goats to be selected. Then, we selected goats in different days. Next, we collected an insect and investigated form changes of spicular. The survey of spicular degeneration characteristics of T. ovis was done by preserving an insect in 10% of formalin and examining form changes in different days. The survey of floating property of insect eggs and digestion remnants of T. ovis was done First, we made sugar solutions with different specific gravity. Then, we floated insect eggs and remnants in different development stages.  2. Results 2.1.

Development and degeneration of spicular of T. ovis The form changes of spicular in different stages of internal and external development are as follows (table 2). As seen in table 2, the spicular parasitic to the goats developed within 95 days and the form of spicular was round and in external condition it was degenerated into glass-shape after 14 months. － 109 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche104(2015) Table 2.

In cecum, the parasitism rate was 40.1%, the highest of them. The development of spicular of T. ovis parasitic to goats occurs within 95 days and outside the goat bodies spicular of round shape are changed into glass shape after 14 month. The specific gravity of infiltrative eggs of T. ovis parasitic to goats is 1.23.  References  [1] 강동규; 조선민주주의인민공화국 과학원통보, 3, 59, 주체96(2007). [2] 리옥; 조선민주주의인민공화국 과학원통보, 6, 58, 주체102(2013).
