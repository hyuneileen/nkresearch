Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 4 No. 1 Juche104(2015) On Fractional Differential Compatibility Equation of  Viscoelastic Body and Its Application Kim Jun Yong Abstract This paper deals with the expression of compatibility equations of viscoelastic material in terms of fractional derivatives and its applicability and validity by analyzing a number of quasi-static and dynamic problems of viscoelastic body. Key word viscoelastic body Introduction  Recently the compatibility equations of viscoelastic materials in the form of fractional derivatives are widely used in the field of viscoelasticity[1－12]. As these equations are formulated on the basis of the consideration of viscoelastic materials as the combination of finite number of elastic members and spring-pots and are based on the assumption that volume strain is elastic, these have some shortcomings in the analysis of multi-axial stress-strain state of viscoelastic bodies, the influence of viscosity on the volume strain, the hysteresis characteristic of the viscoelastic bodies and come other problems, and in their solving methods. We will derive the fractional differential compatibility equations from these compatibility equations of integral form and investigate their applicability and validity through the analysis of a number of quasi-static and dynamic problems of viscoelastic plate. 1.

The deflection behavior of viscoelastic plate with respect to time is shown in Fig. 1. In the case where a load acted before con- sideration and vanished after consideration, the deflection is equal to the first term of expression (11). This shows that the deflection of a moment is composed of the sum of the deflections by the load that has been acting throughout since the moment of consideration and by the load that acted before consideration.
