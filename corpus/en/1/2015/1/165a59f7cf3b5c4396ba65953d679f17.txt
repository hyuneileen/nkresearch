Mill) is a perennial shrub belonging to Fabaceae which is derived Protein content in its seeds is different according to varieties, but contains 18.5～26.3% of dry mass. The protein consists of 16 kinds of amino acids, so pigeon pea becomes ideal supplementary food in countries where rice is the staple food [1]. Leaves contain 19% of protein [16], organic acids, abundant vitamin A and B [8]. Phenolic components in leaves of pigeon pea have been actively studied since 1970s [4－ in India [16]. 7, 12, 18]. From stem and bark of pigeon pea, a researcher separated and identified 5 isoflavonoids of which 3 compounds were antifungal isoflavones, one was isoflavanone and the other was cajanol [12]. Another scholar separated and identified cajanin, cajanol, cajaflavanone and 2 isoflavones from root and seeds of pigeon pea [20]. In India, genistin was separated and identified from root, and isoflavon glycoside, genistein, 2′-O-methylcajanon, cajaisoflavone from root bark [4－7]. In a certain country, stilben was separated from leaves of pigeon pea and its structure was clarified by MS and NMR (1H, 13C) [13]. 17 kinds of flavonoids have been separated and identified from root, stem, seeds and leaves of pigeon pea [4－8, 12, 18]. Many researchers studied the effect of protein fraction of pigeon pea seeds on cholesterol content and neutral lipid content in rats and revealed that feeding 18% protein fraction added to feedstuff － 81 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche104(2015) lowered the contents significantly [9, 14, 17]. Many researchers reported that isoflavonoids in pigeon pea leaves expanded the coronary arteries and brain blood vessels and decreased oxygen consumption, so they were highly effective in treatment and had no toxicity when they were used in hyperpiesia, dizziness, stenocardia, cerebral arte- riosclerosis, hyperlipemia and so on [2, 3]. Especially, it was clarified that isoflavonoids such as genistein in pigeon pea leaves inhibited angiogenesis when several kinds of cancer cells in human bodies were increasing [2, 3, 11, 15]. Because genistein has specific apoptosis inducing function on several kinds of human cancer cells, its anticancer effect is very high [10, 11]. And genistein is a phytoestrogen and it acts like estrogens [19, 21]. Until now, many researchers have analyzed components in several organs such as seeds, stem and root of pigeon pea, but there are no data, which deal with isoflavonoids of leaves. We separated and identified isoflavonoid components in leaves of pigeon pea cultivated in ecological conditions of Korea in order to identify components which are used effectively for prevention and treatment of hyperlipemia and arteriosclerosis. 1. Materials and Method 1.1. Materials Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) was planted on May 10, 2009 and harvested on Oct. 25 in Pyongyang area. Then its leaves were used as material for analysis after drying in shade until the water content became 10%. 1.2. TLC analysis Absorbent Silica gel G60 F254 (glass plate), Silica gel H (for column) Development solvent ethyl acetate–methanol (10：1) for the 1st development, benzol–ethyl acetate (7：3) for the 2nd development Developer iodine vapor, 5% solution of ferric chloride If one spot appeared by dropping 10～30 gμ by 1st and 2nd dimension TLC, it was considered as single substance and tested. 1.3. Extraction and separation of total isoflavonoids and individual substances Total isoflavonoid was extracted and separated with methanol, petroleum ether and ethyl acetate and individual substances were separated by column chromatography and recrystallization. 1.4. Measuring instruments and devices used for identification of individual substances In experiment are used infrared water measuring instrument “Kett F-1A”, trace melting point measuring instrument “Yanaco”, polarimeter “Cartzeless-OT”, ultraviolet spectrophotometer “Shimadzu UV-265”, infrared spectrophotometer “Shimadzu IR-420”, mass spectrometer “JMS-DX300”, 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer “Brüker WM-250” (measuring condition: inner standard substance TMS, frequency 100MHz) － 82 － Isoflavonoid Components of Leaves of Cajanus cajan 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Composition of total isoflavonoids By TLC of total isoflavonoids of pigeon pea leaves, 10 spots appeared of which Rf values are 0.95, 0.9, 0.87, 0.72, 0.61 and 0.55 and the main spot’s Rf was 0.72. 2.2. Extraction and separation of total isoflavonoids and individual substances 500g of dry leaves of pigeon pea was extracted 3 times for 24 hours in 25℃ with 10 times of methanol and the extract was condensed by reducing pressure to 100g of methanol extract (water content 30%). This was dissolved in 200mL of hot water, put for 2 hours, filtered and the sediments were thrown away, and the filtered solution was extracted 3 times with 60mL of petroleum ether respectively, the extracts were added, condensed to 6g of petroleum ether fraction (mother liquor). The mother liquor of petroleum ether extraction was extracted 5 times with 60mL of ether respectively, added, dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulphate, decompressed and condensed to 9g of ether extract. This was dissolved in 40mL of alcohol and analyzed by column chromatography. Substance 2 (Rf 0.95, 60mg) was separated from fractions No. 29－38, substance 4 (Rf 0.9, 100mg) from No. 19－25 and substance 6 (Rf 0.87, 120mg) from No. 4－16 respectively. The residue of petroleum ether extraction was extracted with 60mL of ethyl acetate respectively, added, dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulphate, decompressed and condensed to 14g of ethyl acetate fraction. This was dissolved in 95% and the sediments were separated, dissolved in 50% solution of warm ethanol and put for 12h, and formed crude crystal was recrystallized with hot water resulting in pale yellow needle-shaped crystal (Rf 0.72, 1 000mg, substance Ⅰ). Then, pale yellow crude crystal powder taken after evaporating alcohol from 95% alcohol extract was dissolved in hot distilled water, sucking filtered and condensed to 20mL of filtrate, and put for 12h in 4℃. The formed crystal was recrystallized with hot alcohol to colorless pillar-shaped crystal (Rf 0.61, 560mg, substance Ⅲ). Insoluble sediment (2.4g) was dissolved in alcohol, mixed with absorbent (10g), dried, passed through 0.1mm sieve, filled carefully in column (5cm×30cm) which comprised silica gel (100g) and separated with ethyl acetate: methanol (10：1). (separated fraction 3mL, eluting rate 1mL/min) Every separated fraction was identified by TLC. Fractions (No. 13－20) were evaporated to be needle-shaped crystal. This was recrystallized with mixed solution of alcohol and ether (1：1) to be needle-shaped crystal (Rf 0.55, 400mg, substance Ⅴ). 2.3. Identification of individual substances 2.3.1.

The specific peak of which m/e value is 270 would be genin molecular ion peak which appeared when genin without saccharide part lost one electron and ionized. 1H NMR, δ(ppm): 6.48(1H, d, J=1.86 C6－H) and 6.73(1H, d, J=1.86 C8－H) are divided ) ) are divided into coupling constant J=8.61 because 2 protons into coupling constant 1.86 because 2 protons act in m-position. 6.84(2H, d, J=8.61 and 7.42(2H, d, J=8.61 −′−′ 3 HC H C C 5 −′−′ C 2 6 act respectively in o- and m-position. 8.42 (1H, S, C2－H), 9.65 (1H, S, C4－OH), 12.94 (1H, S, C5－OH) and 5.07 (1H, d, J=6.06) show that proton acts in 1 position, the constant J=6.06 becomes supplementary evidence of −β glucoside bond. In order to identify substance Ⅰ  more concretely, it was hydrolyzed, so it was clarified that its binding saccharide is glucose and genin is genistein. The physical properties and structure analysis data of substance Ⅰ were consistent with those of glycoside genistin, so it was identified as genistin (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Genistin (genistein-7-glucoside) Identification of substance Ⅲ  This is colorless column-shaped crystal, dissolved in hot methanol and ethyl acetate and acetone, and insoluble in chloroform and ether.

Namely the proton of C6 position was divided into coupling constant J=8.60 by interaction with proton of C5 position, then reacted with C8 proton of meta-position, so C6 proton was divided into 4 lines. Then C8 proton reacted with C6 proton of meta-position to be divided into coupling constant J=1.80 (double line), so C6 and C8 protons appeared in multiple lines (6 lines). C1 proton of substance Ⅲ appeared as double lines in 5.11ppm (1H, d, J=7.5), which shows that substance Ⅲ has −β glucoside bond. In order to identify substance Ⅲ  more concretely, it was hydrolyzed, so it was clarified that its binding saccharide is glucose and genin is daidzein. The physical properties and structure analysis data of substance Ⅲ were consistent with those of glycoside daidzin (Fig. 2).

And multiple lines appeared at 7.05～7.29ppm by protons of C6 and C8. On the other hand, 5.05 (1H, d, J=6.68) showed that proton reacts at 1 position in saccharide molecule. The value of coupling constant of C1 proton showed that substance Ⅴ comprises glycoside bond. In order to identify substance Ⅴ  more concretely, it was hydrolyzed, so it was clarified that its binding saccharide is glucose and genin is formononetin. The physical properties and structure analysis data of substance Ⅴ  were consistent with those of glycoside ononin, so it was identified as ononin (Fig. 3). 2.3.2.

And the specific peak of which m/e value is 152 is divided ion peak of A-ring type which has 2 hydroxyl group, which showed that these two divided ions are the main compounds of substance Ⅱ. Namely substance Ⅱ would be isoflavone compound in which A ring is combined with B ring. In order to identify substance Ⅱ  more concretely, TLC analysis and mixed melting test were done with control of genistein sample.

As the result of 1H NMR, the chemical variation values of all protons were slight higher than substance Ⅴ (ononin) because in ononin glucose was bound in 7 position, so the electrons moved a bit in the whole molecule.

Namely the chemical variation values in 3.82, 7.48, 8.13, 8.07 and 6.87ppm were higher a bit than those of ononin. But there was no signal by binding saccharide. Therefore, substance Ⅵ should be formononetin which was formed by removing glucose molecular from ononin (Fig. 6). Fig. 6.
