Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 4 No. 1 Juche104(2015) Relationship between the Promoter-Methylation of Suppressor Gene-SFRP2, HPP1 and Some Clinical Pathologic Indices in Rectal Cancer Kim Song Hak, Kim Yong Suk, Kim Myong Nam and Kim Sang Ok Abstract We analyzed the relationship between methylation status in promoter region of tumor suppressor genes SFRP2 (secreted frizzled-related protein 2), HPP1 (hyperplastic polyposis protein 1) in tissues, stools of 68 rectal cancer patients and 60 healthy men, 49 FFPET (Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissues), and their clinical pathologic signs. Genomic DNA was isolated from the tissues by phenol/chloroform method and modified by sodium bisulfate, and then it was purified using 1% agarose gel. Using purified DNA as template, we analyzed the methylation status of promoter CpG Island of tumor suppressor genes-SFRP2 and HPP1 by applying MS-PCR (methylation specific-PCR). The promoter methylation rates of SFRP2 were 3.3, 0% in tissues and stools of normal, whereas they were 94.1, 89.7% in patients with rectal cancer. The promoter methylation rates of HPP1 were 0% in both of tissues and stools of normal, whereas they were 92.3, 86.8% in patients with rectal cancer. Key words promoter methylation, SFRP2, HPP1, rectal cancer  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said. “Drawing on the successes already achieved, medical science must open the fields of genetic engineering, immunology and molecular biology and stimulate research to adopt widely in curative and preventive services the latest scientific and technological achievements, including electronics and laser engineering.”(“ON THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE HEALTH SERVICE” P. 18) Hypermethylation of the promoter regions of genes are connected with many kinds of carcinogenesis including rectal cancer, hepatocarcinoma, lung cancer, gastric cancer and breast cancer.  Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes by methylation of discrete regions of the CpG islands is a major mechanism underlying tumor genesis [2, 4]. In recent years, hypermethylation of the promoter regions of genes are increasing more and more in cancer genesis. Many cellular pathways such as DNA repair (hMLH1, MGMT and BRCA1), cell cycle (p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p14ARF, and Cyclin D2), hormone and receptor-mediated cell signaling (ER, RARβ2 and THRβ), transcriptional regulation (HOXA5), apoptosis (RASSF1A, Twist and HIN1) are inactivated by these epigenetic events [8, 9]. However, not a gene is methylated in kinds of every tumor; it was obvious that strong specificity is apparent with respect to the original tissue [3, 5, 6]. － 97 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche104(2015) Rectal cancer tends to appear increasingly in many countries in the world, particularly; there are quite differences of incidences according to regions and countries. In addition, in many cases, it probably has close relations with heredity and environmental factors [1, 7]. We are going to analyze the methylation status of promoter regions of tumor suppressor gene-SFRP2 and HPP1 in the patients with rectal cancer, and clarify the relationship between the methylation of suppressor gene and its clinical pathologic signs. 1. Material and Method 1.1. Material 49 FFPET (Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissues), biopsy tissues, stools from 60 normal people and 68 patients with rectal carcinoma who were path-histologically confirmed in Tumor Institute of Medicine Academy and hospital of Pyongyang Medical College of Kim Il Sung University are used. 1.2. Method After separating genomic DNA from different samples (tissue, stool), genomic DNA was repaired using bisulfite sodium, and then purified in 1% agarose gel. AS this purified genomic DNA, we carried out MS-PCR and observed the results using 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 10μL of DNA solution (1μg DNA) was denatured with 1μL of 3mol/L NaOH for 15min at 37℃. 6μL of 10 mmol/L hydroquinone and 104μL of 3mol/L sodium bisulfite (pH 5.0) were added, followed by incubation at 50℃ for 16h. The modified DNA was purified using 1% agarose gel. The purified DNA was desulphonated with NaOH and precipitated with absolute ethanol in the presence of glycogen and ammonium acetate [6, 7, 10]. MS-PCR was carried out using 50～100 ng of bisulfite treated DNA in a PCR mixture containing 1×PCR buffer, 2mmol/L MgCl2, dNTPs each at 1.25 mmol/L and primers each 1.6μmol/L and 0.7U of Taq polymerase in a 15μL reaction. PCR product was confirmed by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The primer sequence is same as table 1. Table 1.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of MS-PCR product of HPP1 1－6－methylated specific primer, 7－DNA marker, 8－10－non-methylated specific primer Next, we examined the methylation rate of SFRP2 and HPP1 from tissues and stools of normal person and patient with rectal cancer. Table 2 shows that methylation rate of tissues and stools of SFRP2 were 3.3, 0% in normal,and 94.1 and 89.7% in rectal cancer. The methylation rate of patient with rectal cancer was clearly high when compared with the normal, but it was no significant differenence between the tissues and stools. Table 3 shows that methylation rate of tissues and stools of HPP1 were 0, 0% in normal, and 88.2 and 86.8% in rectal cancer. The methylation rate of patient with rectal cancer was clearly high to compare with normal, but it was no significant difference between the tissues and stools. Table 2.

Conclusion  We analyzed the methylation rate of SFRP2 and HPP1 from tissues and stools of normal person and patient in rectal cancer. The methylation rate of patient with rectal cancer was clearly high when compared with the normal, but it was no significant difference between the tissues and stools. The promoter methylation rate of SFRP2 were 3.3, 0% in tissues and stools of normal were 94.1, 89.7% in patients with rectal cancer. 86.8% in patients with rectal cancer. The promoter methylation rate of HPP1 were 0, 0% in tissues and stools of normal, and 92.3, We analyzed the clinical significance by showing the relationship between promoter methylation of SFRP2, HPP1 and clinical pathologic indices such as age, history, stage, grading and differentiation grade of the patients with rectal cancer. There was no clear correlation between the promoter methylation of SFRP2, HPP1 and clinical pathologic indices of patients with rectal cancer. － 100 － Relationship between the Promoter-Methylation of Suppressor Gene-SFRP2, HPP1 and … References [1] B.
