Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 4 No. 1 Juche104(2015) A Method for Discovering the Existence of Phosphorus in Leach Liquor of Phosphorite Ri Myong Ho, Ju Ryong Ho Abstract In this paper, we considered a method for discovering quantitatively the existence and content of phosphorus in leach liquor of phosphorite, the mineral fertilizer resource. Research result shows that the rate of free phosphate ions among the phosphorus in leach liquor 4HPO that the plant can easily of phosphorite is 72 to 81%, that is most of them and 2POH , − 4 −2 absorb become fundamental thing. 19 to 28% of the phosphorus in leach liquor of phosphorite exists CaHPO ) in the form of ion pairs, especially phosphate ion pairs combined with Ca ( CaH , 2PO + 4 0 4 are most of them. In case the plant absorbs the free phosphate ions and the balance of system is destroyed, these ion pairs are dissociated to free ions and let the dynamic balance of system maintain. Key words leach liquor, phosphorite, existence, ion pair, free ion  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said. “Research in the basic sciences should be intensified. Now that science and technology are advancing at a rapid pace and the role of modern technical devices is increasing rapidly in production and construction, there is an urgent need for the basic sciences to be developed still further.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 35 P. 312) One of the theoretical and practical problems in using the phosphorite as mineral fertilizer resource is to discover correctly phosphorous content that the plant can easily absorb among the various kinds of phosphorus in leach liquor of phosphorite. It is impossible to analyze quantitatively the existent form of phosphorous compounds including free ions and ion pairs in leach liquor of phosphorite by present chemical analytical method [3, 4]. This problem can be only solved by calculation of existence of phosphorus on the basis of diagnosis model for the multi-component system [1, 2, 5]. In this paper, we proposed the model that can discover quantitatively the existence and content of phosphorus and determined various kinds of phosphorous content in leach liquor of phosphorite based on this model. 1. The Theoretical Consideration for Free Ions and Ion Pairs existing in Leach Liquor of Phosphorite Phosphorite includes various phosphates such as calcium phosphate, iron phosphate, aluminum － 112 － phosphate, etc. PO(Ca 3 ) 24 . each other. A Method for Discovering the Existence of Phosphorus in Leach Liquor of Phosphorite Calcium phosphate that is most of these phosphates has 3 forms, i.e. calcium dihydro- CaHPO , and tricalcium phosphate , calcium monohydrogenphosphate POH(Ca genphosphate 2 ) 24 4 POH(Ca 2 ) 24 − 4 Ca 2 ←→ ←→ Ca ←→ Ca3 2 + + + + 2 POH2 2 2 4 − HPO + + PO2 − 3 4 4 ) 24 CaHPO Ca 3 (PO Various free phosphate ions and ion pairs in leach liquor of phosphorite exist in dynamic balance plant absorbs The plant absorbs only free phosphate ions such as − 4HPO among them. When the 4 4HPO , dynamic balance of free phosphate ions and ion pairs in solution are destroyed and ion pairs are dissociated to free ions, that maintains the dynamic balance of multi-component system. 2POH 2POH and , −2 −2 − 4 The determination data of phosphorus in leach liquor of phosphorite shows only total phosphorus contents of free phosphate ion and ion pairs-combination of these free phosphate ions and various positive ions. In order to calculate the content of free phosphate ions that the plant can absorb practically among phosphorus in leach liquor of phosphorite, we made diagnosis model that can discover the quantitative relationship for existence and content of free phosphate ions and ion pairs.  Ions and ion pairs necessary for making diagnosis model are shown in table 1.
