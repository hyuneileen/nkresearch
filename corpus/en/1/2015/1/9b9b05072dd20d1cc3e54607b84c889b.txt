Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 4 No. 1 Juche104(2015) The Method of Eutrophic Assessment for the River Area by Remote Sensing O Nam Chol Abstract We performed the eutrophic assessment using remote sensing which is one of the essential problems in the water environmental management of water area and made a base that can process scientifically the environmental management. As the result of the study, we assessed trophic state of study area using trophic state index as high accuracy and made a picture of distribution field. Key words remote sensing, eutrophication  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said. “The most important aspect of environmental protection is to completely prevent en- vironmental pollution”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 39 P. 349) There is an urgent need to assess eutrophic phenomenon in solving a number of important This paper deals with the process, how to determine eutrophic phenomenon level using remote environmental problems. sensing. Eutrophic assessment by trophic state index (TSI) is easy to control and it has a relative high accuracy. It can rapidly process eutrophic assessment of wide water area with a visual education and can apply to other rivers. 1. Theoretical Basis for Eutrophic Assessment In terms of water environmental assessment and conservation, the eutrophic problem is very important. If it becomes eutrophicaton some water area because of any reason, this one gets rapidly several algae involving green algae and indigo algae, and so it is occurred lack phenomena of DO, finally water quality becomes bad. The cause of eutrophic phenomena for water area can explain with several methods, but main factor is contributed to chlorophyll, nitrogen, phosphorus [1－9]. Nitrogen, phosphorus which cause eutrophication is generated by a decomposition process of organic and inorganic compound in many cases. However, eutrophication phenomenon, mostly in two ways, that is caused by natural action and artificial action by economic action of human. Because sewage and wastewater include a large mount of N and P etc. According to data, generally 90～95% of total nitrogen involving in waste water is ammoniac nitrogen. － 124 － The Method of Eutrophic Assessment for the River Area by Remote Sensing 2. The Method of Eutrophic Assessment by Trophic State Index (TIS) We assessed the eutrophic state of study area using TSI. The TIS method is one, which selects a few main water quality index and converts its concentration to TIS, and assesses by dividing trophic status (oligo to eutropic) into continuous value within 0 to 100. As the water quality index used in eutrophic assessment, we selected Chl − , >OP. NH3 − , organ phosphorus (OP) and its relative importance is Chl − > NH3 − N N a a Chlorophyll is comparatively stable a range of it in algae. chlorophyll concentration in water is a main index of algae distribution and plays very important role in assessing aquatic plants and eutrophication. Generally, remote sensing of chlorophyll is contributed to two ways. First, it is to decide chlorophyll concentration in accordance with a reflex peak’s position around 700nm of chlorophyll. Second, it is to establish the method of chlorophyll concentration calculation using a reflex peak’s position around 700nm of chlorophyll and reflex ratio of 675nm (or 560nm) ravine. A researcher suggested the following models by analyzing relations between Chl − and TM a bands [4].
