Key words partial impact and friction, rotational machine, misalignment, nonlinear dynamic characteristics Introduction The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said. “We should actively develop the major areas of basic sciences such as mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology so as to raise the national standard of science and technology and find more effective solutions to the scientific and technical problems that arise in the different branches of the national economy.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 35 P. 313) Among the all kinds of faults of rotational machine, impact and friction are very important because these should make trouble in stationary production and raise serious accident. So these must be discovered in time. There are many studies in connection with the vibration analysis of rotational machine working with partial impact and friction [1－3]. But in the previous studies investigators used the linear function of impacting force in connection with the deformation of impacted surface in alignment rotor model, while they studied dynamic characteristics of rotor machine accompanied by impact and friction. In this paper we will consider the nonlinear function of impacting force in connection with the deformation of impacted surface in misalignment rotor model, while we study dynamic characteristics of rotor machine accompanied by impact and friction. 1.
