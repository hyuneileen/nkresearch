Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 4 No. 1 Juche104(2015) Effect of Particle Size on Oxidation Reaction Kinetic Parameter of Cu2O Powders Pang Myong Il, Jon Myong Jun Abstract The 0.4mol/L CuSO4 liquor and 5mol/L NaOH liquor were prepared using CuSO4·5H2O and NaOH as raw materials. The Cu2O powders were prepared using glucose as reducer and polyvinylpyrrolidone(PVP) as dispersant. The Cu2O oxidation reaction DTA-TG-DTG curves were obtained by using SDT-2960 thermal analysis apparatus. The measurement condition was that temperature rise rate is 15℃/min and reducing gas is air. The oxidation reaction kinetic parameters of Cu2O powders were calculated using DTA-TG-DTG curves data. The results indicate that the shapes of cuprous oxide powders were spherical, their particle sizes were respectively 100, 200, 1 000nm. Their apparent activation energy were respectively 164.38, 175.54, 282.65 KJ/mol, the apparent activation energy increases with increase of Cu2O particle size. Their frequency factors were respectively 1.22×1013, 1.40×1013, 2.88×1020. Their reaction progressions were respectively 1.02, 1.00, 0.96, the reaction progressions decrease with increase of Cu2O particle size. Key words Cu2O, particle size, kinetic parameter, oxidation Introduction The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung said. “Scientists must conduct research on the production of stainless steel using raw material which is plentiful here, using a small amount of nickel or none at all, and then should also conduct research in the production of corrosion-resistant materials which can be used to replace stainless steel.”(“KIM IL SUNG WORKS” Vol. 37 P. 360) The research about the physical and chemical properties of nano-particles and nano-materials is a hot topic in the nanotechnology scopes. But the research on the kinetic parameters of different particle size is very rare. Calculation methods of nonisothermal caloric analysis kinetics were plenty [1－5]. In this paper, oxidation reaction kinetic parameters of different Cu2O particle size were studied by using Arrhenius formula. The oxidation reaction kinetic parameters of Cu2O powders were calculated using DTA-TG-DTG curves data. The Cu2O oxidation reaction kinetic parameters include apparent activation energy E, frequency factor A and reaction progression n. － 49 － Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) No. 1 Juche104(2015) 1. Calculation Method Arrhenius formula is as follows. ⎛ exp ⎜ ⎝ where k is the specific reaction rate constant, E is the apparent activation energy(J/mol), A is the frequency factor, R is the gas constant(J/(K·mol)), T is thermodynamic temperature(K). (1) Ak = ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ − E RT In both sides of equation (1) logarithm were adopted, and then we can get following equation. ln k −= + ln A (2) E RT A straight line was obtained by the linear relation between lnk and 1/T. E was obtained from the slope of the straight line, A was obtained from the intercept of lnk axis. Where k is defined as: d α dt = k 1( α ) − (3) n where t is time, α is the conversion rate, and n is the reaction progression. If the temperature rise rate is β, β=dT/dt. If dt＝dT/β is substituted into equation (3), equation (4) can be obtained. Namely n ) α d α dT = k 1( − β k = ( d dt βα / ) n 1( − ) α (4) (5) By using equation (5), k can be possibly calculated. Reaction progression n is obtained by calculation of the Kissinger peak shape factor [6]. Fig. 1 shows the exothermic peak of DTA curves, peak shape factor is defined as ba /= I , a and b are peak shape indexes, their sizes are shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, finds the inflection point in the both sides of DTA curve peak-shaped. Secondly, makes tangent of passing DTA curve inflection point. Thirdly, makes lines parallel to longitudinal axis and passing the intersection of two tangents. Fourthly, makes lines parallel to horizontal axis, respectively with the two tangent intersections. The parallel line of horizontal axis is divided into two segments, these are respectively a and b. Reaction progression is defined as: n = 1.26I1/2        (6) Fig. 1. Peak shape factor of the DTA curve By the DTA curve, according to equation (6), the reaction progression n can be obtained. Using α, β, dα /dT, n and equation (5), k is calculated. － 50 － Effect of Particle Size on Oxidation Reaction Kinetic Parameter of Cu2O Powders 2.
