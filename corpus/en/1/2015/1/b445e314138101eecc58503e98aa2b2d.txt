Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 4 No. 1 Juche104(2015) Calculation of Resonance Region Group Constants of LWR Fuel Cell by using of WIMS69 Groups Library Ho Il Mun, So Chol Abstract We have established the calculation method to obtain resonance region group constants considering geometric and material properties, Doppler broadening and interaction between resonance isotopes in fuel cell of LWR. Key words LWR, effective resonance integral, group constant  Introduction  The main problem in preparation of group constants for nuclear reactor physical calculation is to calculate resonance cross sections. In 69 energy group structure of WIMS library the resonance region is defined to lie between 4.0eV and 9.118keV(from 15th group to 27th group). The WIMS library contains a set of tabulations of the resonance integral for a homogeneous mixture of the resonance isotope and hydrogen[1－4]. By using the equivalence theorem and Carlvik’s rational approximation, we obtained the values of effective resonance integral of heterogeneous fuel rod cell of LWR from the tabulation of the resonance integral of WIMS library. Using interpolation method depending on value of R (ratio of actual resonance integral to infinitely dilute value) and taking account of interaction effects between different resonance isotope, we enhanced correctness of calculation of resonance cross sections. 1. Calculation Method on Group Constants of Resonance Region in Heterogeneous Infinite Lattice for neutrons originating in same place, We firstly consider the case of an isolated fuel rod. The first collision probability in fuel rod ffp , is the quantity related to the style, size and macroscopic total cross section, tFΣ , of fuel rod and then can not be represented by correct analytic equation. Therefore, in practice, the following rational approximations are applied[4]. xx ),1 /( axx /( ), (1) Wigner  (Bell cylinder )16.1 + + = a where x l Σ= and l 4= tF is the mean chord length. x /(2( x + /(1)2 − x + )),3 Carlvik p ff = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ / f SV f In the case of fuel rod with low-enriched UO2 which is used in LWR, errors of above three approximations for 13 groups in resonance region are from 10 to 18, 5 to 10 and 1 to 2% respectively at the range of x , 0.4 to 5.0. － 60 － Calculation of Resonance Region Group Constants of LWR Fuel Cell by using of … From calculation experiences, if the error in value of ffp is 10%, the error in calculation of effective resonance integral is about 2% [2]. On the other hand, if the cell in heterogeneous infinite lattice consisting of fuel rods arranged regularly in moderator comes to equivalent cylindrical cell with white boundary condition, there exists the following relation between the first collision probability in fuel rod of this equivalent cell, FFp , and the first collision probability in isolated fuel rod, ffp , of neutron. p FF = p ff + x 1( − p 2 ) ff /( x 1( − p ff ) + ) A (2) where A , the quantity relative to geometric and material properties of cell, is A = tS f 2 ) 0 S γ bb ( fb S f + S b 0γ b = ∞ P bi ∑ i ≠ f ,               (3) t fb 1( − t fb ) .

Conclusion  We established numerical method to obtain resonance region group constants which take account of geometric and material properties of LWR heterogeneous fuel lattice by using of WIMS 69 group library. Carlvik’s rational approximation is used for the self collision probability in the isolated fuel rod. We derivated formula for collision and transmission probabilities need to calculate the first collision probability within fuel in infinite array by using the white boundary condition in a cylindrical pin cell. Interaction effects arising from overlap of resonances associated with different isotopes are taken into account in it. And the correctness of various approximations applied in calculation of resonance region group constants have been compared to each other. － 64 － Calculation of Resonance Region Group Constants of LWR Fuel Cell by using of … References 1～45, 1976.
