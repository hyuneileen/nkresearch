Journal of Kim Il Sung University (Natural Science) Vol. 4 No. 1 Juche104(2015) Research for Using Nanoferric Tetroxide as a Strain for Biopsy of Sentinel Node in the Patients with CNo Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Stage Ⅰ, Ⅱ) So Hyon Il, Kim Kwang Ho, Song Chun Hui, Ri Nam Gil and Jang Pyong Chol Abstract We studied endostability of nanoferric tetroxide in mice and rats and lymph tropism of nanoferric tetroxide in rabbits. Based on it, we injected about 4mL of nanoferric tetroxide of 30 mg/mL to the submucous layer around local lesion 1 day before operation for 32 patients of oral squamous carcinoma. We examined lymph node, which is pigmented black on eyes, pathologically for extracted tissue after operation. As a result, nanoferric tetroxide had no toxicity, irritability, and good blood safety and doesn’t give minus influence on heart and liver function. Nanoferric tetroxide, of which size is 20 to 120 nm, has clear lymph tropism, and when we assessed presence metastasis of cervical node by biopsy of sentinel node for using nanoferric tetroxide in 32 patients with oral squamous carcinoma (stage I, II), it has 90.9% of hyper-affectivity, 100% of specificity, 96.6% of accuracy and 9.0% of actual extract rate. Key words nanoferric tetroxide, oral squamous carcinoma, sentinel node, lymph node excision  Introduction  The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said. “The most important factor in the current development of medical science and technology is to concentrate on solving the pressing scientific and technological problems in the health service.”(“ON THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE HEALTH SERVICE” P. 18) It is the most important problem to stop metastasis of tumor cell in the treatment of malignant tumors. Especially, the stream of vessels and lymph is very complicated in the oral and maxillofacial region and the patients of oral squamous carcinoma (stage I, II) have high metastasis rate of lymph nodes by cancer cell from the beginning, so cervical nodes excision for stopping metastasis of cancer cell has great significance clinically. The most important problem of them is to confirm the sentinel node and its presence of metastasis of cancer cell and the presence of success of lymph nodes dissection depends on it. In 1977, Cabanas described lymph nodes, which cancer cell of mother tumor arrived at first through the lymph duct, sentinel node for the first time [1, 3, 4, 11]. Usually lymph nodes of human organ are connected with rounded nodes and lymph stream has regular and order property. If the first lymph nodes don’t occur metastasis, there is little possibility to occur metastasis at the － 102 － Research for Using Nanoferric Tetroxide as a Strain for Biopsy of Sentinel Node in … next nodes. So many researchers have been widely studying for biopsy of the sentinel node in the treatment of cancer patients. A researcher studied activated charcoal strain for getting the most suitable biopsy effect of the sentinel node [2, 5, 8, 10]. Generally, good lymph strains must be quickly absorbed at the lymph tissue, correctly indicate lymph duct and node and stay for a long time to concentrate at the sentinel node. And they must have no toxicity and cheap price. Recently researchers have found out that organic and inorganic nanograin, whose size are 100 to 600nm, have lymph tropism and studied for biopsy of the sentinel node as a strain [6, 7, 9, 10]. However, we could not find data for using black nanoferric tetroxide as a strain of the sentinel node until now. We have studied for using nanoferric tetroxide as a strain for biopsy of the sentinel node in the patients of oral squamous carcinoma (stage Ⅰ, Ⅱ). 1. Materials and Objects 1.1.
